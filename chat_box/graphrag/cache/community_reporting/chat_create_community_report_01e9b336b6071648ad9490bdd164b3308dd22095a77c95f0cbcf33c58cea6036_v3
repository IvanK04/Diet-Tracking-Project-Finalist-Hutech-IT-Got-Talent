Pork liver is described as rich in iron, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin B12, making it a nutrient-dense food. Cá rô, a freshwater fish, is explicitly mentioned as containing vitamin B12 and selenium. Ribeye is also highlighted as a source of vitamin B12 and protein. This widespread presence in diverse food types suggests that B12 is accessible through a variety of dietary choices, which may influence public health recommendations.

Specifically, vitamin B12 is described as essential for the formation of red blood cells and for preventing anemia. It is also directly linked to the proper functioning of the nervous system, with one relationship stating that vitamin B12 supports the function of the nervous system. This dual role makes B12 a vital nutrient for both hematological and neurological health. The connection to the nervous system is further reinforced by a relationship between the nervous system and vitamin B12, indicating a functional dependency.
