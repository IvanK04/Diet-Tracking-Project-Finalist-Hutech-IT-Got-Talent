The community highlights the interplay between vitamin A and immune health, with supporting evidence from multiple food sources and biological functions.

It exists in two forms—preformed vitamin A (retinol) from animal sources like chicken liver and provitamin A (carotenoids) from plant sources such as carrots and sweet potatoes. The vitamin is essential for gene regulation, epithelial tissue development, and immune defense. Its presence across diverse dietary sources makes it a foundational component of human nutrition. This centrality is reinforced by its multiple relationships with other entities, including immune function, whole chicken, and eggplant.

This connection is further reinforced by its role in regulating gene expression and maintaining healthy mucous membranes and epithelial tissues, which are critical barriers against pathogens.

Plant sources such as carrots, sweet potatoes, black beans, almonds, and bơ tươi (fresh coconut oil) contain provitamin A carotenoids, which the body converts to retinol. While bơ tươi is noted as a source in the description, it is emphasized that this is a trace or minor source, and the primary and well-documented sources remain animal products and carotenoid-rich vegetables. This diversity in dietary sources reflects the adaptability of vitamin A intake across different populations and food systems. The relationships between VITAMIN_A and whole chicken (1317) and eggplant (1582) support this nutritional breadth.

While eggplant is primarily known for its high content of vitamin C, potassium, and other nutrients, the presence of vitamin A adds to its nutritional profile. This connection highlights the multifaceted nature of plant-based foods and their contribution to essential micronutrients.

This establishes a secondary pathway through which immune function is indirectly supported via vitamin C. While DAO is not directly linked to vitamin A in a functional capacity, its role in immune support through vitamin C creates a complementary nutritional network. The relationship between DAO and vitamin C (ID: 1572) is clearly defined and supports the broader immune health narrative. This suggests that the community's influence on immune function is not limited to vitamin A alone but extends through other nutrients in different food sources.

While corn is not directly linked to vitamin A in the provided data, its role in providing antioxidants and energy contributes to overall health. The relationship between corn and scallops (ID: 1940) is more about culinary use than nutritional overlap, suggesting a limited functional connection.
