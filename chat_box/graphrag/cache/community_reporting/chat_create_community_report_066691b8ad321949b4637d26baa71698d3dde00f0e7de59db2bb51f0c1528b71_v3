This classification is explicitly stated in the relationships, indicating a deliberate alignment with health-focused macronutrient management. For instance, RAU CAI XOONG XÀO TOI is described as a low-carb dish with high fiber and calcium content, while RAU CAI NGỌT XÀO has a low carbohydrate content of 3.1g and is rich in vitamin C and dietary fiber. These attributes support the health claims associated with low-carb diets.

Additionally, the low-carb trend is described as a structured macronutrient approach focused on reducing carbohydrates and increasing fat consumption, primarily for weight loss and metabolic health.

The relationship between Eat Clean and Keto indicates that both prioritize natural ingredients and minimal processing, though keto is more restrictive in carbohydrate levels and emphasizes high fat intake. Eat Clean is described as focusing on natural, minimally processed foods, while keto is a structured approach to macronutrient balance. This overlap suggests a convergence of consumer interest in healthy, natural eating, but with differing implementation strategies.

This categorization reflects a broader culinary classification system that groups plant-based meals together, emphasizing their health benefits such as low-carb and high-fiber content. The 'MÓN CHAY' category is a key organizational structure within the community, providing a framework for identifying vegetarian options. This classification supports the community's focus on plant-based, health-conscious meals.

This information suggests a nuanced understanding of dietary trade-offs within the community. However, no direct claims are made about individuals or entities promoting muscle gain through these dishes, so the implication is limited to general nutritional advice.
