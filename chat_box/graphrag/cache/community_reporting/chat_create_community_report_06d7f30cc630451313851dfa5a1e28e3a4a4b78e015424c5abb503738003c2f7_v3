The trend is not limited to a single cuisine or preparation method, as it spans dishes from various cultural traditions, including pork liver sautéed with watercress, roasted duck, Trạch tẩm bột chiên, and Tôm sốt cà chua. This broad applicability suggests that the high-protein category functions as a unifying framework in nutritional discourse. The description emphasizes that the high protein content contributes to sustained energy and physiological performance, aligning with active lifestyles and health-conscious consumer behavior.

For example, Trạch tẩm bột chiên contains 62.7g of protein per serving, while Tôm sốt cà chua provides 16.5g of protein. Roasted duck and pork liver sautéed with watercress are also noted for their high protein levels, supporting muscle development and recovery. These dishes are not only nutritionally rich but also serve as practical meal options for individuals seeking balanced diets. The consistency in protein content across diverse dishes reinforces the credibility and scalability of the high-protein dietary trend. This data supports the claim that high-protein meals are both accessible and effective for health goals.

This nutrient is essential for maintaining healthy eyesight, immune function, and skin health. The presence of vitamin A in multiple dishes suggests that these meals are designed to meet comprehensive nutritional needs. The association between vitamin A and protein-rich meals indicates a synergistic benefit in dietary planning, where protein supports muscle function and vitamin A supports metabolic and visual health.
