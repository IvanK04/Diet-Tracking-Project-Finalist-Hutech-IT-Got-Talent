It is used in raw or minimally cooked forms and mellows into a sweeter flavor when stewed or roasted, allowing it to complement other ingredients without overpowering them. Garlic is botanically classified as a bulbous plant containing sulfur compounds, most notably allicin, which is released when crushed and is responsible for its strong aroma and potential health benefits, including antimicrobial and cardiovascular support. This compound is central to both the sensory and functional role of garlic in cooking. The relationship between garlic and Vietnamese cuisine is well-documented and consistent across multiple sources, reinforcing its importance in traditional recipes.
