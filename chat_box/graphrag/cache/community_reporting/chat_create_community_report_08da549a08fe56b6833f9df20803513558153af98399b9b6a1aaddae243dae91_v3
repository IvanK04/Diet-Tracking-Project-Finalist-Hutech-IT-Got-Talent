It is explicitly identified as a precursor to vitamin A and plays a vital role in supporting eye health, immune function, and skin integrity. The nutrient is present in a wide range of food sources, including sugarcane juice, pineapple juice, fish, tomatoes, and specific dishes such as Nộm bò khô, Cháo lươn cay, rau cải ngồng xào tỏi, and Cá rô phi rán. In these dishes, beta-carotene content varies significantly, with the highest concentration reported in Cá rô phi rán at 2850 µg per serving. This variation underscores the diversity of dietary sources and the nutrient's adaptability across different culinary traditions. The consistent recognition of beta-carotene's health benefits across all descriptions reinforces its importance in promoting overall well-being, particularly in populations with limited access to vitamin A-rich foods.

Pumpkin is described as a nutritious winter vegetable rich in beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, making it a nutrient-dense food that supports multiple aspects of wellness, including immune function, eye health, and gastrointestinal health. Similarly, Bí đỏ hồ lô is noted as a source of beta-carotene and dietary fiber, with a sweet, natural flavor that enhances when roasted. These vegetables are positioned as accessible and health-promoting foods within traditional Vietnamese diets. The presence of beta-carotene in both is supported by direct relationships: pumpkin contains beta-carotene (Relationship 1530), and Bí đỏ hồ lô is explicitly stated to supply beta-carotene (Relationship 1599). This dual presence highlights the versatility of beta-carotene across different food types and cooking methods.

The dish is described as having a balanced flavor profile—sour, spicy, salty, and sweet—enhanced by a dressing that includes roasted peanuts, which contribute healthy fats and protein. The high levels of beta-carotene and vitamin C support immune function and eye health, positioning the dish as a valuable component of a balanced diet. Rau muong, the primary ingredient, provides the fresh, crisp base that defines the texture of the dish. The dish is also linked to other elements such as roasted peanuts and soup base, which contribute to its overall nutritional value.

The dish contains essential nutrients such as calcium (96mg) and beta-carotene (573.1 µg), which contribute to bone and joint strength and eye health. The calcium content is directly linked to cardiovascular and skeletal health, while the beta-carotene supports immune function. This dish is also associated with a soup base, which enhances flavor and provides a savory base, further enriching its nutritional profile. The combination of protein, calories, and micronutrients makes it a substantial meal, particularly in a traditional Vietnamese context.

Ginger is valued for its strong aroma and spicy flavor, primarily due to the presence of gingerol, a compound associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. It is widely used in culinary and medicinal practices to support digestive health, reduce nausea, and alleviate bloating. Pumpkin, on the other hand, is rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, contributing to immune function, eye health, and gastrointestinal wellness. The relationship between ginger and pumpkin (Relationship 1529) indicates a shared presence in traditional cooking, suggesting that these ingredients are often used together in recipes to enhance both flavor and health benefits. This synergy highlights the holistic approach to nutrition in Vietnamese cuisine, where multiple ingredients are combined to deliver comprehensive wellness outcomes.

Bell peppers are described as non-spicy, crisp, and available in various colors (green, red, yellow, orange), with mature varieties being sweeter. They are particularly rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene, contributing to their health benefits. The relationship between Capsicum annuum and Bell pepper (Relationship 957) establishes a clear biological hierarchy, where the plant species gives rise to the edible vegetable. This connection reinforces the idea that nutritional value is rooted in the plant's natural composition. Bell peppers are also noted for their hollow interior, which makes them ideal for stuffing, and their thick skin, which maintains crispness when cooked. This information supports the broader theme of nutrient-rich, plant-based foods in traditional diets.
