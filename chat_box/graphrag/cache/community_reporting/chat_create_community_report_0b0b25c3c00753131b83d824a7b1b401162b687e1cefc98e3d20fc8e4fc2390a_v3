Seaweed is identified as a major natural source of iodine, which is essential for thyroid hormone production and metabolic regulation. Iodine is commonly added to salt to prevent deficiency, and both iodine and seaweed play critical roles in supporting thyroid health and metabolic balance. The network reflects a well-established nutritional and physiological chain, emphasizing public health strategies around iodine supplementation and dietary sources.\",\n    \"rating\": 2.0,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is low because the community represents a fundamental nutritional and physiological relationship with no evidence of harmful actions, controversies, or public safety risks.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Seaweed as a primary natural source of iodine\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Seaweed is highlighted as one of the richest plant-based sources of iodine, making it a key natural dietary contributor to iodine intake. This relationship is central to the community's structure and underscores seaweed's role in supporting thyroid function and metabolic health. The high iodine content in seaweed positions it as a valuable, sustainable, and nutrient-dense food source, especially in plant-based and health-conscious diets. This natural source provides an alternative to fortified foods, particularly in regions where salt fortification may be limited or inaccessible.

Its deficiency is linked to serious health conditions such as goiter, hypothyroidism, and developmental delays, particularly in infants and children. This establishes iodine as a foundational nutrient in human health, with public health strategies relying on its availability to prevent deficiency disorders.

This function is critical for maintaining normal physiological processes, including body temperature, heart rate, and energy utilization. The mechanism by which iodine supports metabolism is tied to its role in hormone synthesis, making it a key player in overall metabolic health.

This fortification practice is especially important in regions where dietary sources of iodine are insufficient or unavailable. The addition of iodine to salt provides a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective method for population-level nutrition improvement.
