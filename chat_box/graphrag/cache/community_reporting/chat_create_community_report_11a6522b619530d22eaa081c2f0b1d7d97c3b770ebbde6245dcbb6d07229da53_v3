It integrates both plant-based and animal-based foods, such as fish dishes like ca thu chen and ca tre chen, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12. The diet is structured around low fat, high fiber consumption, which aids in weight management and long-term wellness. This framework is not defined by a single food item but by a coherent pattern of eating that prioritizes nutrient-dense, minimally processed ingredients.

It is described as having 62 Kcal and providing a high amount of beta-carotene (2444 µg), which supports antioxidant activity and healthy skin. Its soft, sweet texture after cooking makes it a popular and accessible component in daily meals. The dish is explicitly recognized as a key component of a healthy diet due to its low calorie, low carbohydrate, and high fiber content, which supports weight management and antioxidant intake. This nutritional profile aligns with the broader goals of the HEALTHY DIET pattern, particularly in promoting metabolic balance and immune function.

It contains 216 Kcal, 14.3g protein, 13.6g carbs, and 11.7g fat, making it a substantial contribution to daily nutritional intake. The dish supports heart health and overall nutrition through its high content of essential nutrients. However, it may cause allergic reactions in some individuals due to the presence of mushrooms, which is an important consideration for dietary recommendations. This potential allergenicity introduces a minor caveat in its widespread adoption, though it remains a valuable component within the HEALTHY DIET framework.

Rau cải ngọt xào and rau cải chíp xào nấm are not only standalone components but also serve as examples of how specific foods contribute to the overall nutritional goals of the HEALTHY DIET. The combination of fiber-rich vegetables and high-protein meals supports digestive health, satiety, and sustained energy levels. This balance is critical for long-term wellness and disease prevention. The inclusion of diverse food types—such as leafy greens, root vegetables, and fermented or cooked plant-based items—ensures a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals. This diversity enhances the diet's effectiveness and adaptability across different populations.
