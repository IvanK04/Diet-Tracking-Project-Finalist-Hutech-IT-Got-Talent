It plays a vital role in ensuring proper blood clotting, which prevents excessive bleeding and supports wound healing. Additionally, it facilitates calcium utilization in the skeletal system, contributing to the formation and maintenance of strong bones and reducing the risk of fractures. This dual functionality makes Vitamin K essential for both adults and children, and deficiencies can lead to impaired clotting and weakened bone structure. The entity description explicitly states that Vitamin K is 'indispensable' for blood clotting and bone health, reinforcing its foundational role in human physiology.
