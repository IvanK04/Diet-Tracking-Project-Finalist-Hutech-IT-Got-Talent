Its role in skeletal strength and muscle contraction is emphasized across multiple data points, establishing it as a cornerstone of human nutrition. The mineral is widely distributed in both plant-based and animal-based foods, with specific examples including black beans, almonds, leafy greens, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, salmon, chicken livers, catfish fillet, dairy products, and certain traditional dishes like cháo gà and chè thái. These sources collectively affirm calcium's broad dietary availability and critical importance in daily nutrition.

Their slightly bitter taste is noted in some descriptions, though cooking methods such as stir-frying or simmering in soups are commonly used to improve palatability and digestibility. The high vitamin K content in turnip greens is especially significant for blood clotting and bone health, making them a valuable addition to a balanced diet. Additionally, their use in a variety of culinary applications—such as stir-fries, soups, and sautés—demonstrates their versatility and integration into traditional and modern Vietnamese cooking. The nutritional density and earthy flavor profile support their status as a health-promoting ingredient.

It is described as low in calories and offering a mild spicy flavor, making it suitable for use in salads and soups. The presence of vitamin K is particularly important for blood clotting and bone health, aligning with broader nutritional goals for maintaining skeletal integrity. The combination of calcium and iron supports both bone and red blood cell health, contributing to overall well-being. This makes cai xoong a valuable component in traditional Vietnamese diets that emphasize plant-based nutrition.

This characteristic positions it as a traditional remedy with potential health benefits, particularly in the context of treating colds and improving skin health. The antibacterial action of perillen oil is directly linked to its use in folk medicine, suggesting a historical and cultural basis for its application. While the primary focus of the community is nutritional, the antibacterial properties of kinh giao may contribute to its broader health value, especially in preventive care.

For example, turnip greens are linked to vitamin C, which supports immune function and skin health, while also contributing to calcium intake. Similarly, cai xoong is associated with vitamin K, which supports blood clotting and bone health. Kinh giao is connected to vitamin C and antibacterial properties, reinforcing its role in immune support. These interconnections demonstrate how traditional dishes are not only culturally significant but also nutritionally balanced, providing multiple health benefits from a single food source. This synergy enhances the overall value of these foods in a health-conscious diet.

These values indicate that calcium is not only present in raw food sources but is also concentrated in cooked meals, particularly those involving animal-based proteins. The variation in calcium content across dishes reflects differences in preparation and ingredient composition. Leafy greens like turnip greens and cai xoong are highlighted as significant contributors to calcium intake, especially in plant-based diets. This information is valuable for nutritional planning and public health recommendations, particularly in populations seeking to increase calcium consumption without relying on dairy.
