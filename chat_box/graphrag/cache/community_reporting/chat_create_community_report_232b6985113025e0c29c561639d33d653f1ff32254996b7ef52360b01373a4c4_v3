Cooking oil is linked to several allergens including pork (THỊT_HEO), soybean (DƯA_NÀNH), and sesame, and is associated with health tags indicating it contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and is suitable for vegan diets. These relationships highlight potential health risks for individuals with allergies, particularly those sensitive to common food allergens. The community reflects a network of food safety and dietary compatibility concerns, with implications for consumer health and product labeling.\",\n    \"rating\": 7.5,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the potential for severe allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to pork, soybean, or sesame, which are present in cooking oil and may go undetected without proper labeling or consumer awareness.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Cooking oil contains multiple allergens that pose health risks\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Cooking oil is identified as a product that contains several known food allergens, including pork (THỊT_HEO), soybean (DƯA_NÀNH), and sesame. These allergens are explicitly listed in the metadata and are directly linked to the cooking oil through specific relationships. For individuals with allergies to these substances, consumption of cooking oil could trigger severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Pork (THỊT_HEO) and soybean (DƯA_NÀNH) are explicitly listed as allergens in the metadata for cooking oil, and these are linked through specific relationships. These allergens are particularly concerning because they are common triggers for allergic reactions in certain populations, including those with food allergies or specific medical conditions. The inclusion of these allergens in a widely used cooking product increases the potential for unintended exposure, especially in households or food service settings where ingredient transparency is limited.

This is a critical point because sesame is a known allergen that can cause severe reactions in sensitive individuals. The fact that sesame is present in cooking oil—without explicit labeling—raises concerns about consumer safety, especially in environments where allergen disclosures are not consistently enforced. This hidden allergen risk may lead to health incidents in schools, restaurants, or homes where cooking oil is used without proper ingredient checks.

These fatty acids are important for human health, particularly for cardiovascular and brain function. However, the presence of these beneficial nutrients is counterbalanced by the allergen risks, especially for individuals with allergies. The dual nature of cooking oil—providing essential nutrients while posing allergen risks—creates a complex profile that requires careful consumer education and product labeling.

This attribute makes it a popular choice in plant-based and vegan food preparation. However, this benefit is undermined by the presence of allergens such as soybean and sesame, which are derived from plants and may still trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. The suitability for vegan diets does not eliminate allergen risks, and consumers must be aware that plant-based ingredients can still be allergenic. This creates a potential gap in consumer understanding, where individuals may assume that vegan products are inherently safe.

Consumers, especially those with known allergies, rely on clear ingredient disclosures to avoid harmful products. The current data shows that allergens such as pork, soybean, and sesame are present in cooking oil, but there is no indication that these are clearly labeled or disclosed in product information. This lack of transparency increases the risk of accidental exposure and could lead to health emergencies. Regulatory bodies may need to enforce stricter allergen labeling standards for cooking oils and similar products.

This means that not all cooking oils contain omega-3s, and the presence of this nutrient is variable. This variability introduces uncertainty in health claims and consumer expectations. For individuals relying on omega-3s for health benefits, such as those with cardiovascular or neurological conditions, this variability may affect the reliability of the product as a health solution. The data does not specify which types of cooking oil contain omega-3s, which limits the ability to make definitive health recommendations.

While 'Me' is not directly linked to cooking oil, the relationship between almonds and 'Me' suggests a broader allergen network. This implies that allergens like 'me' may be present in various food products, and their presence in other items could compound risks. Although no direct link exists between 'Me' and cooking oil, the broader allergen ecosystem suggests that cross-contamination or shared processing environments could pose risks.
