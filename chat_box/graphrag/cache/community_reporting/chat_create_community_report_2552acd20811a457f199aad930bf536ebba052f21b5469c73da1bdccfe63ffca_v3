This ingredient is not only a flavor enhancer but also a nutritional component, contributing protein and vitamins. However, its derivation from peanuts makes it a critical health hazard for individuals with peanut allergies. The presence of this allergen in multiple dishes within the community increases the risk of allergic reactions if consumed by sensitive individuals. This is particularly concerning in communal or household settings where food is shared.

However, the categorization may also raise concerns about health implications, especially if consumed in excess or without medical supervision. The dietary event 'tăng_cân' is not inherently dangerous, but when combined with high-calorie and high-fat content, it may contribute to unhealthy weight gain or metabolic strain.

These values suggest that both dishes are energy-dense and may be suitable for individuals with high caloric needs. However, their high fat and carbohydrate content could contribute to adverse health outcomes if consumed regularly without balance. Additionally, both dishes contain high levels of calcium, protein, and potassium, which are beneficial for bone and muscle health.

This is especially relevant in regions where traditional dishes are commonly consumed and may not be clearly labeled with allergen warnings.
