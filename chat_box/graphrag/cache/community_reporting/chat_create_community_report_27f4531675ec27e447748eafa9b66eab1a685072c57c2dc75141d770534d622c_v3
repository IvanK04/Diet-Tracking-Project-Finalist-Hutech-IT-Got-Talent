The dish contains 537.4 calories, 20.8 grams of protein, 50.2 grams of carbohydrates, and 28.1 grams of fat, indicating a high-calorie, high-carbohydrate profile. It is tagged with moderate energy, high protein, and high carbohydrates, and is explicitly noted as dairy-free. This composition makes it a significant food item in dietary and nutritional contexts.

The ingredient tôm (shrimp) is explicitly identified as a key component and is directly linked to seafood allergens. Additionally, the bread roll (bánh mỳ) may contain gluten, especially if made with wheat-based flour, which is a common allergen. These allergens make the dish unsuitable for individuals with seafood or gluten sensitivities or allergies. The presence of these allergens is a critical consideration in food safety and dietary planning.

It is a key component of the dish and directly linked to allergens, particularly seafood. The relationship between Burger Tôm and tôm (ID 533) is strong, with a combined degree of 7, indicating a significant dependency. This ingredient not only contributes to the flavor and texture of the dish but also introduces health risks for those with seafood allergies. The use of shrimp in a widely consumed format like a burger may increase exposure to allergens in public food settings.

It is described as a mayonnaise-based sauce that adds flavor and is commonly used in sandwiches. The relationship between Burger Tôm and sốt mayonnaise (ID 534) has a combined degree of 7, indicating a strong functional link. While mayonnaise is generally safe for most people, it may contain eggs and sometimes oil, which could be concerns for individuals with egg allergies or high-fat dietary restrictions. However, no direct health risks beyond allergens are mentioned in the data.

The combination of the bread roll with other ingredients forms the structural foundation of the meal. The relationship between Burger Tôm and bánh mỳ (ID 976) has a combined degree of 11, indicating a high level of integration. This suggests that the bread roll is not just a container but a critical component in the dish's identity and consumption. However, the data does not specify the type of bread or whether it contains gluten, which could be a point of concern for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.
