This practice is well-documented and widely accepted in food culture. The relationship between pickled ginger and sushi is central to the community's structure and function.

This use is explicitly described in the entity descriptions and is reinforced through the relationship with the throat entity. The act of consuming sushi is often preceded by the ingestion of pickled ginger, which helps to neutralize the sharpness of raw fish and prepare the oral cavity for subsequent bites.
