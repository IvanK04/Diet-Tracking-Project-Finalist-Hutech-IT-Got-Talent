This entity is described as having a crunchy texture and being a good source of essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, and selenium. These attributes position it as a functional food item with potential health benefits, particularly in supporting joint and skin health due to its collagen content. The nutritional profile is explicitly stated in the entity description, indicating a clear focus on dietary value.

This connection highlights the biological significance of collagen in the context of dietary intake. While collagen itself is not described in detail in the entity data, its association with pork ears provides a clear pathway to its nutritional relevance. The relationship underscores the potential health benefits of consuming pork ears, particularly for individuals seeking to support connective tissue health.

This relationship is supported by a high combined degree (30), indicating strong emphasis on the protein content in the data. The protein-collagen synergy is further reinforced by the fact that both nutrients are derived from the same food item.
