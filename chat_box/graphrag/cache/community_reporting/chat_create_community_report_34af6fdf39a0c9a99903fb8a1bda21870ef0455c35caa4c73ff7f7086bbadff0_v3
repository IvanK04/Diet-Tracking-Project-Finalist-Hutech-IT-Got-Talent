It plays a key role in cellular respiration and the conversion of macronutrients into usable energy. This function is consistently emphasized across all descriptions, with no contradictory claims. Riboflavin is found in a wide range of dietary sources, including animal products like pork chop, chicken, and eggs, as well as plant-based foods such as green peas, mushrooms, garlic, and citrus fruits. Its presence in both animal and plant-based diets ensures broad accessibility. The vitamin's role in maintaining metabolic health and skin integrity further underscores its importance in daily physiological function.

It supports brain development and function, particularly during critical developmental stages, and is involved in amino acid metabolism and immune function. The nutrient is widely distributed in foods like chicken, chicken wings, garlic, lemon, kale, and edamame, making it accessible across diverse diets. Its role in neurotransmitter production highlights its importance in mental health and neurological well-being. The relationship between vitamin B6 and neurological function is explicitly stated in the data, reinforcing its significance in cognitive and emotional regulation.

It supports the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to generate cellular energy and is involved in the production of fatty acids and certain hormones. The vitamin is found in a broad range of foods, including pork chop, chicken wings, green peas, green cabbage, and mushrooms, indicating its widespread availability. Its presence in both animal and plant-based sources ensures that deficiency is rare in typical diets.

This combination supports multiple physiological functions: riboflavin aids in red blood cell formation and energy metabolism, vitamin B6 supports neurotransmitter synthesis and protein metabolism, and pantothenic acid enables fatty acid synthesis and energy production. The presence of these vitamins in peanut butter highlights its nutritional value and makes it a key dietary component in promoting metabolic and neurological health. This relationship is supported by three distinct data records, indicating a strong and consistent link between peanut butter and the three B-vitamins.

This relationship is explicitly stated in the data and reinforces the idea that even processed sweeteners can contribute to essential nutrient intake. The presence of riboflavin in brown sugar, derived from the addition of molasses to white sugar, provides a minor but meaningful source of this B-vitamin. While brown sugar is primarily a sweetener, its nutritional content adds value in supporting metabolic processes. This connection underscores the broader principle that even common food items can contain bioactive nutrients.
