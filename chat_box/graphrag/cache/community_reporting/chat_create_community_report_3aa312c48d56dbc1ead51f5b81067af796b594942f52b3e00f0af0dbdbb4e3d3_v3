It plays a critical role in supporting nerve function and maintaining heart health, making it vital for neurological and cardiovascular systems. Thiamin is widely distributed in various food sources, including bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, sunflower seeds, carp, bean sprouts, chicken livers, and sticky rice. These dietary sources contribute to the body’s ability to convert carbohydrates into usable energy, which is crucial for daily physiological functions. The consistent presence of thiamin across diverse plant and animal-based foods underscores its broad availability and nutritional significance. This widespread distribution ensures that individuals from various dietary backgrounds can access thiamin, reinforcing its importance in public health.

Riboflavin is found in a wide range of foods, including bơ tươi, black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, chicken livers, sunflower seeds, and carp. These sources highlight its broad dietary availability and importance in human nutrition. The presence of riboflavin in both plant and animal-based foods makes it accessible to diverse populations. Additionally, descriptions note that riboflavin supports cellular processes and tissue integrity, particularly in the skin and eyes. This makes it a foundational nutrient in balanced diets.

It is rich in protein and contains approximately 22 grams of protein per 85-gram serving, with fat content ranging from 6 to 10 grams. The meat is particularly noted for its high vitamin B12 content, which is vital for red blood cell formation and proper nervous system function. This makes it a valuable dietary component, especially for individuals at risk of deficiency, such as vegetarians and vegans. Additionally, boneless pork chop contains riboflavin, further enhancing its nutritional profile. The versatility of this cut in cooking—such as grilling or pan-frying—makes it a popular choice in both home and commercial kitchens. Despite its lean nature, care must be taken during high-heat cooking to prevent drying out.

Ground cinnamon contains polyphenols and is low in calories, supporting blood sugar stability and weight management. It is often used as a flavoring ingredient in dishes containing pork, enhancing taste without adding significant calories. Almonds are rich in healthy fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, with 13.98g of fat per 28g serving. They contain essential vitamins such as vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and pantothenic acid. These nutrients support energy metabolism, immune function, and overall health. Both foods are linked to heart health through their fat composition. Almonds are also noted for their role in energy metabolism and cellular function.

These vitamins work synergistically to maintain cellular energy levels and support vital physiological functions. The concept of energy metabolism is explicitly tied to multiple entities, including thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, and is reinforced through their presence in food sources. This shared metabolic function creates a cohesive network of nutritional relationships.

The relationship between boneless pork chop and meat-free explicitly states that 'Boneless Pork Chop is not meat-free as it is derived from pork.' This directly contradicts the definition of 'meat-free' as a food characteristic. This inconsistency highlights a data integrity issue within the dataset, where a food item derived from animal sources is incorrectly labeled as meat-free. Such a misclassification could lead to confusion in dietary planning, especially for individuals following vegetarian or vegan diets.
