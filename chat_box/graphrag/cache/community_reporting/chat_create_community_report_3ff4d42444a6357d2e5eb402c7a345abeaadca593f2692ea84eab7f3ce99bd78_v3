Its use in Middle Eastern salads is specifically noted, indicating a cultural specificity that may influence regional food preferences and dietary habits. The presence of mint in salads is not only about taste but also about perceived health benefits, as it is associated with digestive support and a refreshing experience. This makes it a preferred ingredient in health-conscious or traditional meal preparations. The sensory appeal of mint—its menthol-rich aroma and cooling effect—can significantly influence consumer choice, especially in dishes where balance and freshness are valued.
