Each of these vitamins plays a critical role in human metabolism, energy production, and cellular functions. For example, thiamin (B1) supports nerve function and energy metabolism, while folate (DFE) is vital for DNA synthesis and cell division. These nutrients are present in both mangosteen and pears, suggesting a shared nutritional value across Rosaceae fruits. The presence of these vitamins in mangosteen is documented across multiple relationships, indicating a consistent and scientifically supported nutritional profile.

The data confirms that both mangosteen and pear are members of this family, which implies shared characteristics in terms of plant structure, flavor, and nutritional content. This shared classification supports the idea that mangosteen and pear are nutritionally and biologically comparable, which may influence dietary recommendations or agricultural practices. The relationship between pear and Rosaceae further reinforces the biological coherence of the network.

This relationship indicates that vitamin C is not only a component of the fruit but also a functional element in its preparation and utilization. Antioxidants are important for reducing oxidative stress in the body, which can contribute to long-term health benefits. The inclusion of vitamin C in the processing chain suggests that the nutritional value of mangosteen is optimized through specific preparation methods.
