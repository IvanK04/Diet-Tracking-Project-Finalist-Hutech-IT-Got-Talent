Similarly, the high energy density and crispy texture are also documented as health tags, indicating a calorie-rich and potentially unhealthy profile. The food's preparation method—deep-frying with added seasonings and sauces—contributes to its sodium accumulation, making it a dietary concern in public health contexts.

While it contains high sodium levels, which pose risks for individuals with hypertension, it also offers potential benefits for gut health due to its fermentation process.

The health tag HÀM_LƯỢNG_NATRI_CAO directly links this food to sodium-related risks, reinforcing its inclusion in dietary guidelines for sodium restriction [Data: Relationships (1440)].

Soy sauce is also produced via fermentation using soybeans and wheat, which creates its umami flavor and dark color [Data: Relationships (1293)]. This shared process highlights a broader culinary and nutritional pattern in Asian cuisine. Fermentation not only contributes to flavor but also introduces beneficial microbes, which may support gut health. However, the fermentation process in both cases also results in high sodium content, creating a trade-off between nutritional benefits and health risks.

This pairing is a common culinary practice that reflects both nutritional and flavor synergy. While green leaf lettuce itself is a healthy food choice, its combination with high-sodium ingredients like soy sauce or fried chicken can contribute to higher overall sodium intake in meals.
