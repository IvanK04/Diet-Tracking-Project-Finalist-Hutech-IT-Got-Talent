This widespread availability supports its role in energy metabolism and skin health. The vitamin is essential for converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy, making it a fundamental component of metabolic function. Its presence in both animal-based (e.g., chicken livers, pork sausage) and plant-based (e.g., red cabbage, bean sprouts) sources ensures accessibility across different dietary patterns. This broad dietary distribution reduces the risk of deficiency and supports public health through balanced nutrition.
