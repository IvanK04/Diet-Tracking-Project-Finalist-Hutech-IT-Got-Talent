Boneless pork chop is identified as a high-quality protein source, while heart-healthy diets are defined by low saturated fat and high antioxidant intake. The two entities are linked through a relationship indicating that boneless pork chop contributes to protein intake, which is part of a broader dietary framework that supports cardiovascular health. However, the connection between pork chop and heart-healthy diets is indirect and context-dependent, as pork chop contains protein but may not inherently align with low saturated fat criteria.
