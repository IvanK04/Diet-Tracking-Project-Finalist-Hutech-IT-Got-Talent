This is a critical point in food safety, as it suggests that allergen warnings must extend beyond direct ingredients to include cross-reactive components. The use of egg yolk in Cà phê trứng makes it a direct allergen source, while the shared allergenic profile with Sữa chua nếp cẩm implies a broader risk. This cross-reactivity could lead to mislabeling or underreporting of allergens, potentially endangering vulnerable populations.

This shared ingredient creates a common allergenic pathway for individuals sensitive to milk. The use of concentrated milk, rather than whole milk, may reduce allergen concentration but does not eliminate the risk, especially in individuals with severe allergies.
