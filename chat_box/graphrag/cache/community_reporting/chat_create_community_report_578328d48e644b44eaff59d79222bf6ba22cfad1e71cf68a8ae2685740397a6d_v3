It is highlighted for its high protein-to-fat ratio and its role in supporting muscle development, making it a popular ingredient in balanced diets.

This relationship is explicitly stated in the data and underscores the nutritional value of chicken breast beyond just protein content. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, fatigue, and impaired cognitive function, so the presence of iron in chicken breast positions it as a beneficial dietary component for individuals at risk of such deficiencies.

This claim is supported by a direct relationship between chicken breast and PROTEIN_NAC, indicating its classification within protein-based nutritional categories. The lean nature of the protein makes it particularly suitable for individuals aiming to build or maintain muscle mass while minimizing fat intake. This property is especially relevant in fitness, athletic, and weight-management contexts.

This connection highlights the functional role of chicken breast in physical health and fitness. The low fat-to-protein ratio enhances its effectiveness in promoting muscle growth without contributing excess calories or saturated fats.
