It is grounded in ethical principles related to animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and health. The diet emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as legumes, nuts, grains, vegetables, and plant-derived starches. This framework is not merely nutritional but also philosophical, with a strong emphasis on avoiding exploitation of animals in food production. The exclusion of honey, despite its natural and unprocessed qualities, is a key ethical boundary within veganism, as it involves bee labor and potential harm to bee colonies. This principle is widely accepted across vegan communities and is supported by major vegan organizations.

The relationship between raw honey and the vegan diet highlights a significant ethical conflict: while raw honey contains antioxidants and enzymes like glucose oxidase, its production relies on the labor of bees, which is considered animal exploitation. This undermines the core ethical tenet of veganism—avoiding all forms of animal harm. The data shows that mainstream vegan ethics reject raw honey, even when it is unprocessed or unheated. This exclusion is not based on nutritional deficiency but on moral principles. The contradiction between natural benefits and ethical implications leads to a consensus that raw honey is incompatible with vegan values.

For example, soybean powder is noted for its carbohydrate content and natural sweetness, while dried kidney beans are highlighted for their high protein and fiber. Molasses provides essential minerals like potassium and iron, and starches like potato and tapioca are valued for their thickening properties in gluten-free baking. These ingredients are not only nutritionally sound but also support the dietary diversity and functionality of vegan meals.
