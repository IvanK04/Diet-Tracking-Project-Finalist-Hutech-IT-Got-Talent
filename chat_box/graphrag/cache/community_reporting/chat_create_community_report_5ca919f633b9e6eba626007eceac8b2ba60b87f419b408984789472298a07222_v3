While the description of 'Allergy' is minimal, its connection to a major food product suggests a significant public health implication. This relationship highlights the need for clear labeling, consumer education, and caution in food preparation environments where egg-containing products are used.

This widespread use in diets across various cultures and age groups increases the potential reach of allergen exposure. The high consumption rate means that even a small percentage of the population with egg allergies could be at risk when these eggs are consumed or prepared in shared environments.
