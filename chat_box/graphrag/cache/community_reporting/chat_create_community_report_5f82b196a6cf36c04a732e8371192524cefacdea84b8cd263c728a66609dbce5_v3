The community emphasizes a plant-based, low-calorie, high-fiber approach to weight management using vegetables such as green peas, celery, and water spinach. Despite a noted inconsistency in the term 'GIÀU_VITAMIN_K'—which appears to be a misnomer due to CẦN_TÂY being rich in vitamin K—the overall framework promotes a holistic, scientifically grounded dietary strategy focused on sustainable weight loss through nutrient-dense foods.

The high water content helps maintain fluid balance and supports metabolic processes, while fiber promotes satiety and regular digestion. These functions are particularly beneficial in a low-calorie diet where appetite control is essential.
