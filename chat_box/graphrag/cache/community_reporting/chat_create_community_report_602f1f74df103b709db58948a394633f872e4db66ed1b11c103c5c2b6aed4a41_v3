It is found in a variety of foods including spinach, peanut butter, fish, seeds, kumquats, pork belly, and shallots. The presence of zinc in multiple food groups demonstrates its accessibility across both plant and animal-based diets. Multiple food sources—squid, grouper, amaranth—are explicitly linked to zinc content, indicating that these foods serve as dietary vehicles for zinc intake. The relationship between zinc and immune function is directly supported by the entity relationship linking zinc to immune function. This suggests that individuals consuming these foods may benefit from enhanced immune resilience and tissue repair.

It supports hemoglobin synthesis and protects cells from oxidative damage through its role in neutralizing free radicals. Copper is found in spinach, peanut butter, fish, seeds, kumquats, pork belly, and shallots, indicating broad dietary availability. Its antioxidant function is particularly significant in maintaining cellular integrity and supporting neurological health. The mineral's involvement in iron metabolism and connective tissue formation further highlights its physiological importance. The consistent presence of copper across diverse food sources ensures that it is accessible to various dietary populations.

It is also linked to raw food consumption practices, where raw squid is consumed for its high protein and low fat content. This dual role positions squid as both a nutritional and cultural element within the community. The relationship between squid and raw food consumption indicates a growing interest in uncooked, minimally processed foods for health benefits. While the health benefits of raw squid are not explicitly detailed, its inclusion in raw food practices suggests a trend toward natural, nutrient-dense diets.

They are also noted as a source of zinc, which supports immune function and cellular health. This makes grouper a preferred option for individuals seeking both nutritional value and safety in seafood consumption. The low mercury content differentiates grouper from larger predatory fish, reducing health risks associated with heavy metal accumulation. The link between grouper and zinc reinforces its role in a balanced diet focused on micronutrient intake.
