They are widely used in both raw and cooked forms, particularly in vinaigrettes, sauces, and stir-fries, where they enhance flavor without overpowering other ingredients. This makes them especially valued in French cuisine, where subtlety and balance are central to flavor profiles. Nutritionally, shallots contain 72 calories per 49 grams, with 16.8 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of protein, and 0.1 grams of fat. They are rich in vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, and contain antioxidants such as quercetin, which contribute to their health benefits. These attributes position shallots as a preferred ingredient for health-conscious and flavor-sensitive cooks.

It contains sulfur compounds, most notably allicin, which is responsible for its pungent smell and is believed to offer health benefits including antimicrobial and cardiovascular support. Garlic is used in a wide range of dishes, including traditional recipes like Rau khoai lang xào tỏi and Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, where it enhances flavor and depth. When cooked, garlic can become milder and sweeter, making it adaptable to various culinary applications. Its role in French cuisine is significant, where it contributes to balanced, complex flavor profiles without dominating the dish. This reflects a broader culinary philosophy emphasizing harmony and subtlety.

The relationships show that garlic and shallots are not only botanically related but also share culinary traits, such as being used in sauces and stir-fries. The family's significance is reinforced by its role in shaping flavor profiles across global cuisines, with France exemplifying a refined use of these ingredients. The shared traits—such as sulfur compounds and flavor modulation—highlight a common functional basis for these plants in cooking.

This aligns with the French principle of flavor balance and harmony, where ingredients are selected to complement rather than dominate. The use of shallots in sauces and stir-fries allows for a nuanced depth of flavor that is both refined and complex. This is explicitly noted in the description of French cuisine, which emphasizes the use of shallots to add 'a refined depth to dishes without dominating the overall flavor.' This culinary preference underscores their role as a sophisticated ingredient in high-end and traditional French cooking.

It is central to garlic's strong aroma and is associated with several health benefits, including antibacterial and immune-supporting properties. This compound is directly linked to garlic through a relationship in the dataset, and its presence is tied to both flavor and wellness. The health benefits of allicin are supported by claims that garlic supports human health through its mineral and vitamin content and antibacterial properties. While allicin is not directly linked to shallots, the shared family background suggests a common biochemical foundation. This compound is a key reason garlic is used in both culinary and medicinal contexts.

This nutritional attribute is explicitly stated in the dataset and is linked directly to the shallot entity. Vitamin A is one of several essential vitamins found in shallots, contributing to their overall nutritional value. This makes shallots a valuable ingredient not only for flavor but also for health. The presence of vitamin A supports the idea that shallots are a nutritious component in balanced diets, especially in regions where access to diverse food sources may be limited.
