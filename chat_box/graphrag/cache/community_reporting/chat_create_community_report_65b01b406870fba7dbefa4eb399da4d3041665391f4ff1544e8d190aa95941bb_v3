This indicates a clear supply chain link where beef serves as the foundational ingredient. The description of beef sausage highlights its high saturated fat and sodium content, as well as its dense energy profile, which may influence dietary recommendations. This relationship is foundational to understanding the nutritional and production context of the product.

While pork mince is not directly part of the beef sausage chain, its vitamin profile is mentioned in the context of the broader vitamin content in food products. This suggests that the community's focus on vitamins extends beyond beef-based products to include other meats. However, since pork mince is not linked to beef sausage or beef in the data, its inclusion is peripheral. The vitamin content in pork mince is relevant for nutritional assessments but does not directly impact the core beef sausage-beef relationship.

These vitamins are essential for metabolic and neurological functions. The data shows that these nutrients are present in both beef and beef sausage, indicating that the nutritional value of the sausage is inherited from its raw meat component. This supports the idea that processed meat products can retain key nutritional benefits from their source ingredients. The relationship between beef and the vitamins in sausage is indirect but logically derived from the shared composition.
