This is directly supported by the relationship between garlic and sauces, which highlights garlic's essential role in enhancing the final product. In French cuisine, garlic is often used in foundational sauces such as béchamel, velouté, and reductions, where it contributes to the umami and savory profile. The presence of garlic in sauces is not merely decorative but functional, helping to balance and enrich the overall taste.
