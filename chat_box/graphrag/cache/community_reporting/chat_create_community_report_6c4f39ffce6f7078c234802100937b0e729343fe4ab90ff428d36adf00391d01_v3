These dishes are linked to meals such as ĂN TRƯA (lunch) and ĂN TỐI (dinner), and are supported by health tags including low-fat, high-protein, and high-antioxidant properties. The community also includes ingredients like tỏi (garlic), ớt (chili), and dầu thực vật (vegetable oil), which are used in these meals and contribute to flavor and health benefits. While some dishes like Thịt lợn nạc xay hầm are categorized under 'maintain weight,' the dominant theme is a structured, health-focused approach to eating aimed at reducing body weight through mindful food selection.

These dishes are consistently described as low in carbohydrates and fat, high in protein, and rich in essential vitamins and minerals such as selenium and vitamin B12. For example, Ức gà không da không xương is highlighted for its high protein and low fat content, making it ideal for muscle building and fat reduction. Similarly, fish dishes like Cá tuyết chién and Cá rô phi chién are noted for their low carb and fat content and high selenium, which supports heart health.

For instance, Rau cai is consumed during lunch and is described as part of a low-calorie, vitamin-rich meal with antioxidant properties. Cháo trắng is noted as a low-fat, low-calorie dish consumed across multiple meal times. This integration suggests that the community promotes sustainable, long-term dietary habits rather than short-term fad diets.

Dầu thực vật is used in fish dishes like cá tuyết chién and cá rô phi chién, providing essential fats without allergens. Although one description incorrectly claims DẦU THỰC VẬT has high protein, this is contradicted by its biochemical nature as a fat-based oil and is therefore excluded.

Similarly, the allergen information for Thịt bò xào—such as pork or garlic—is not supported by evidence and appears to be a misattribution.
