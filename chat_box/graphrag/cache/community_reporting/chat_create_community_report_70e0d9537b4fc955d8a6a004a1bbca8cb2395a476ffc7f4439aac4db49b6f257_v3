This ingredient is central to the dish's identity, as it is explicitly identified as the key component in multiple relationships. The use of offal aligns with traditional Vietnamese culinary practices that value every part of the animal, promoting resourcefulness and sustainability. The texture of lòng lợn, when properly prepared, offers a contrast to the crisp, tangy vegetables, enhancing the sensory experience. This ingredient is not merely a component but a defining element that gives the dish its unique character. The dish's reliance on offal also raises allergenic concerns for individuals with pork or animal-derived product sensitivities.
