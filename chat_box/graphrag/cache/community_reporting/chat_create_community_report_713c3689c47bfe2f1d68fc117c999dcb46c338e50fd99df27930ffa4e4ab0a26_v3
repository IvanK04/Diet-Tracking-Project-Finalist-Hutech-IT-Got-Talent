It is described as rich in essential nutrients such as vitamin B12 and iodine, which support human health. Its primary function is dietary, serving as a source of high-quality protein with minimal carbohydrates and fats. This makes it a valuable component in balanced nutrition, particularly for individuals requiring protein and micronutrients.

The relationship between phi lê cá chạch and vitamin B12 is explicitly stated as providing support for nervous system function. This connection underscores the importance of consuming this food product for neurological well-being. Vitamin B12 is essential for the formation of myelin sheaths, which protect nerve fibers, and for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The presence of this nutrient in phi lê cá chạch makes it a beneficial dietary choice for individuals with neurological concerns or deficiencies.

This establishes a clear supply chain from raw fish to a prepared food product. The description emphasizes that catfish is a nutritious freshwater fish, rich in protein, vitamins B12, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, and iodine. This highlights the broader nutritional profile of the raw ingredient and its value in dietary planning. The transformation into phi lê makes it more accessible and palatable for consumers.
