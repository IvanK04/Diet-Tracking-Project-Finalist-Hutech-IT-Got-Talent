Selenium is highlighted for its antioxidant properties and role in thyroid and immune function. Multiple seafood types are linked to selenium content, with cod being a particularly rich source. The relationships show that selenium is not only a standalone nutrient but is distributed across diverse dietary sources, especially in marine and freshwater fish.

Its presence across various food sources makes it a foundational nutrient in human nutrition.

These relationships indicate that selenium is not isolated but distributed across a range of commonly consumed fish. For instance, cod is described as a rich source of selenium, while mackerel fillet contains selenium as part of its nutritional composition, though not as the primary nutrient. Tilapia contains selenium in lower amounts compared to cod, and crab is noted for its selenium content along with vitamin B12 and zinc. This suggests a broad dietary availability of selenium, particularly in marine and freshwater fish.

The relationship between cod and selenium explicitly states that cod, raw, is rich in selenium and is a valuable dietary source of this essential mineral. This makes cod a key contributor to selenium intake in a balanced diet. Its high selenium content, combined with low fat and high-quality protein, positions it as a nutritious and accessible option. The prominence of cod in the selenium network suggests it may be a recommended food for individuals seeking to optimize selenium levels.

This variation suggests that dietary recommendations for selenium intake should consider the type and quantity of seafood consumed. For example, individuals aiming to maximize selenium intake may prioritize cod over tilapia.
