It is described as a fresh herb with significant amounts of vitamin K and vitamin C, contributing to antioxidant and immune-boosting properties. This makes it a valuable ingredient in culinary and health-focused applications. The herb's role in providing essential nutrients supports its use in salads, sauces, and other dishes.

These attributes are explicitly stated in the entity and relationship records, with direct links to vitamin C and general nutritional value. The vitamin C content supports immune function and acts as an antioxidant, which are key health benefits. The high nutritional density indicates that the herb provides a concentrated source of vitamins and minerals relative to its caloric content.

Leek is described as having a mild flavor and being rich in flavonoids and prebiotic fiber, with a mention of vitamin C in its nutritional profile. Rosemary is noted to contain vitamin C, which supports immune function. However, these sources are not as prominently emphasized as Ngò Tây. The presence of vitamin C in these herbs suggests a broader pattern of plant-based foods contributing to immune health, but Ngò Tây remains the most significant contributor in this community.

The data shows that Vitamin K is present in a wide range of foods, including ngò tây, leek, black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, carp, and oils such as peanut and coconut oil. This indicates that the nutrient is widely available across both plant and animal-based diets. The presence of Vitamin K in ngò tây and leek reinforces the herb's role in a balanced diet.
