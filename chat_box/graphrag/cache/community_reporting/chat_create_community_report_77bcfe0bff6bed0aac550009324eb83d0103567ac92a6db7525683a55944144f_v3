The dish is specifically noted for its use of raw beef, pate, industrial chicken eggs, fried potatoes, pickled cucumber, chili paste, and soy sauce, making it a complex and nutritionally rich meal.

The ingredient is described as a premium form of red meat, widely used in traditional Vietnamese cuisine. However, it is also explicitly noted to contain allergens, including red meat, which poses a health risk for individuals with sensitivities.

These allergens are significant because they can trigger adverse reactions in individuals with known sensitivities or allergies. The presence of industrial chicken eggs and soy-based sauce (xì dầu) further increases the risk for those with egg or soy allergies. While the dish is nutritious, its allergenic profile necessitates clear labeling and consumer awareness. This aspect of the community has implications for food safety, labeling practices, and public health messaging in food service environments.

These ingredients are not only essential for taste but also reflect traditional Vietnamese culinary techniques that emphasize balance and complexity.

The dish’s nutritional value makes it a viable option for daily meals in households and restaurants, particularly in urban Vietnamese communities.
