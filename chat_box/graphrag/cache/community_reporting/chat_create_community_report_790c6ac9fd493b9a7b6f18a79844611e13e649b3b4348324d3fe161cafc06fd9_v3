It is considered a lean source of dietary protein and is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, and the B complex (biotin, niacin, thiamin, vitamin B12), as well as selenium and zinc. Due to its dense structure, it requires prolonged cooking methods such as stewing or braising to become tender and palatable. It is commonly used in traditional dishes like soups and stir-fries, where it is believed to help 'clear heat' in the body—a concept rooted in traditional medicinal systems. While this traditional use lacks modern clinical validation, it reflects cultural dietary practices that value organ meats for their perceived health benefits.

This nutrient is essential for the proper functioning of the retina and the production of white blood cells, which are vital for fighting infections. The presence of vitamin A in chicken hearts contributes to their overall nutritional value and makes them a beneficial food choice for individuals with dietary needs for this micronutrient. This benefit is particularly relevant in populations with limited access to other sources of vitamin A, such as fruits and vegetables.
