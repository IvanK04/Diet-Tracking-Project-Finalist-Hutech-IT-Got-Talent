This nutritional attribute positions scallions as a valuable ingredient in diets aimed at supporting cardiovascular and skeletal wellness. The presence of vitamin K in scallions is explicitly stated in the entity description and is directly linked through relationship ID 1585. This connection supports the idea that scallions contribute to essential physiological functions beyond flavor, making them a functional component in health-focused meals.

This relationship is established through relationship ID 2141 and is reinforced by the detailed nutritional profile of millet, which highlights its high fiber and magnesium content. Magnesium's role in metabolic processes is further emphasized in the broader context of human physiology, where it is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions.

These connections are grounded in the biological role of magnesium as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions that regulate cellular electrical activity, ensuring proper nerve signal transmission and muscle contraction. The entity description of magnesium confirms its involvement in over 300 enzymatic processes, reinforcing its foundational role in human physiology. This functional relationship underscores the importance of magnesium-rich foods like millet in maintaining physical and neurological health.
