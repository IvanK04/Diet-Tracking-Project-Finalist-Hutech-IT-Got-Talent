The community also includes allergens like gluten, milk, red meat, and seafood, which are present in various dishes. Relationships reveal that several dishes contain allergens, and these allergens are explicitly noted in ingredient lists and health classifications.

The dish is explicitly linked to the 'giu can' (balanced nutrition) category, indicating its nutritional balance. However, it also contains several allergens, including milk, gluten, and red meat, which are critical health concerns. This combination of nutritional value and allergenic content makes Hamburger Ga a high-risk food item for individuals with dietary restrictions.

The presence of gluten is not merely a compositional detail but a health risk factor that necessitates clear labeling and consumer awareness. The relationship between mỳ vằn thắn and gluten is explicitly documented and reinforced by both ingredient sourcing and health impact statements.

The allergenic nature of milk is explicitly noted in ingredient lists and health classifications, and it is directly linked to multiple food products. For example, Hamburger Beef contains milk as an allergen, and Cà phê trứng uses concentrated milk as a key ingredient. This cross-dish allergen exposure increases the potential for adverse health reactions in consumers with milk sensitivities.

The allergenic nature of red meat is explicitly listed in the ingredient descriptions and health tags, suggesting that it is a deliberate component in the formulation of these products. This poses a serious health concern, especially in food service environments where cross-contamination may occur. The presence of red meat in multiple high-consumption dishes amplifies the community-wide impact of this allergen.

These classifications are important for dietary planning and consumer health, but they also highlight the potential for overconsumption or inappropriate use in vulnerable populations. The nutritional profile of these dishes, especially when combined with allergens, creates a complex risk profile.

These ingredients are not isolated but are part of a network of interrelated dishes. For example, bao my is a base ingredient in Hamburger Ga, and sot mayonnaise is used in both Burger Ca and Burger Tom. This interdependency suggests a shared food system where changes in one ingredient can affect multiple products. This interconnectedness increases the risk of allergen spread and nutritional inconsistency.
