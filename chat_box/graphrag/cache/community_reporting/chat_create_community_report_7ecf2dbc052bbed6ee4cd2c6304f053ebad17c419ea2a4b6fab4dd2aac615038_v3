Each component plays a distinct role—thạch trắng provides structure and gelatinous texture, thạch lá dứa contributes a tropical aroma and flavor, nước đường balances sweetness, and hạt hạnh nhân adds richness and healthy fats. These relationships are explicitly documented in the data, showing that each ingredient is a necessary component of the dish. The interdependence of these elements highlights the precision required in traditional food preparation. This structure also suggests that any disruption in the supply or quality of one ingredient could affect the final product.

These minerals are important for bone health, muscle function, and metabolic regulation. The dish is also described as suitable for weight management, owing to its low-calorie and low-fat profile. While the exact nutritional values are not fully quantified, the emphasis on natural, plant-based ingredients and the absence of artificial additives supports its role as a nutritious snack. The inclusion of almond pieces contributes to the dish’s protein and healthy fat content, though the overall fat content remains low.

The descriptions note that individuals with nut allergies—particularly to almonds—should exercise caution. However, no explicit allergen warnings are listed in the provided data, and there is no mention of adverse health effects or contraindications beyond this potential risk. The absence of formal allergen labeling in the descriptions suggests that the dish may not be widely marketed as allergen-sensitive, but consumers with nut sensitivities should be aware of the ingredient.

For instance, Hoa quả dầm and Chè kem dừa are both described as having moderate energy and high potassium and calcium content. Similarly, Bánh flan caramel and Chè kem dừa are both categorized as low-fat dessert soups. This shared positioning suggests that Chè khúc bạch is part of a larger cultural and dietary framework focused on balanced, natural, and traditional food practices.

Additionally, the relationship between Hahn Nhan and Seaweed, Fresh shows that both are plant-based, nutrient-rich foods considered vegan-friendly. While Chè khúc bạch itself contains almonds, which are animal-derived in terms of processing (though plant-based), the overall ingredient network supports a plant-based ethos. This suggests that the dish can be adapted to vegan diets by substituting almond pieces with other plant-based alternatives. The vegan compatibility of key components enhances its appeal in modern, health-focused dietary trends.

The relationship between chicken thighs and sugar is noted only in a general culinary context, not in relation to Chè khúc bạch. This indicates that the community is primarily focused on ingredient-based composition rather than cross-functional use.
