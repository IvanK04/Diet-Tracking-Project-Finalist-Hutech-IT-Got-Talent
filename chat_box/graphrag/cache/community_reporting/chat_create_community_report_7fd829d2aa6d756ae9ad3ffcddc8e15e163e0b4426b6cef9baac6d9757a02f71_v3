It is described as a precursor to vitamin A and plays a vital role in supporting eye health, immune function, and skin integrity. The nutrient is consistently highlighted in all related food items, indicating its foundational role in the nutritional profile of these dishes. Its presence in both plant-based (e.g., sugarcane juice, pineapple juice) and animal-based (e.g., fish, tomatoes) sources underscores its broad dietary relevance. This widespread occurrence suggests that beta-carotene is not only nutritionally significant but also culturally embedded in Vietnamese cuisine.

This relationship is supported by the description of pumpkin as a nutrient-dense winter vegetable rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. The presence of beta-carotene in pumpkin aligns with its role in promoting eye health, immune function, and gastrointestinal wellness. The fact that pumpkin is categorized as a winter vegetable and used in both savory and sweet dishes further emphasizes its versatility and accessibility. This makes pumpkin a valuable dietary component, especially in populations with limited access to vitamin A-rich foods.

The dish is noted for providing both beta-carotene and dietary fiber, contributing to eye health and immune function. Its description emphasizes its natural, traditional preparation and its cultural significance in Vietnamese cuisine. The fact that it is described as having a vibrant orange flesh and a natural sweetness suggests it is a preferred ingredient in both raw and cooked forms. This makes it a valuable component in promoting balanced nutrition, particularly in rural or low-income communities where access to fortified foods may be limited.

Additionally, roasted peanuts are identified as an ingredient in this dish, contributing flavor and nutritional benefits such as healthy fats and protein. This combination of beta-carotene and protein-rich ingredients enhances the dish’s overall nutritional profile. While the primary focus is on beta-carotene, the inclusion of roasted peanuts adds a layer of dietary diversity and balance. The dish’s traditional preparation and widespread use in Vietnamese households suggest it is a common and accessible source of essential nutrients.

In contrast, Nộm bò khô contains 1181.3 µg per serving. These variations suggest that certain dishes may offer more substantial nutritional benefits than others. This information is critical for dietary planning and public health recommendations, especially in populations with vitamin A deficiencies. The data indicates that while all dishes contain beta-carotene, the amount and bioavailability may differ based on preparation and source.

Dishes such as Nộm bò khô, Cháo lươn cay, and rau cải ngồng xào tỏi are described as valuable sources of this nutrient, emphasizing its role in daily meals. The fact that beta-carotene is derived from both plant and animal sources demonstrates its adaptability across dietary patterns. This cultural embedding suggests that these foods are not only nutritious but also socially and historically significant. The nutrient’s presence in both modern and traditional dishes indicates a sustained effort to maintain nutritional balance in everyday eating habits.

These benefits are particularly relevant in populations with limited access to vitamin A-rich foods, making the inclusion of beta-carotene in traditional dishes a public health asset. The conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A in the body ensures that even in low-dose forms, it can provide meaningful health benefits. This makes traditional dishes rich in beta-carotene valuable tools for nutritional intervention and disease prevention. The data supports the idea that dietary inclusion of these foods can contribute to reducing the risk of vitamin A deficiency-related conditions such as night blindness and weakened immunity.
