It is described as a traditional food with significant nutritional value, particularly in supporting blood formation and cellular development. The presence of vitamin E in Dồi Huyết provides antioxidant benefits, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage.

It is used in Asian cuisine for both decoration and flavoring in desserts and savory dishes. The seeds contain vitamin E and folate DFE, both of which support cellular development and antioxidant activity. However, the data also indicates that Hạt Vừng Đen is a form of Hạt Mè/Vừng, which is listed as an allergen. This dual nature—nutritious and potentially allergenic—creates a public health consideration, especially in food safety and labeling.

This suggests that traditional foods in the community are not only culturally significant but also biochemically valuable in supporting cellular health. The presence of folate DFE in these foods may make them particularly beneficial for populations with deficiencies in cell regeneration, such as pregnant women or individuals with certain medical conditions.

This raises important public health implications, particularly in food labeling, consumer safety, and dietary recommendations. Individuals with allergies to peanuts or seeds must be cautious when consuming Hạt Vừng Đen, as it may trigger allergic reactions.

This convergence highlights how traditional diets can be designed to deliver multiple health benefits through a few key ingredients. The presence of vitamin B6 in both Hạt Vừng Đen and dill further reinforces the nutrient's broad availability. This interconnectedness supports the idea that traditional food systems are not only culturally significant but also scientifically grounded in nutritional science.
