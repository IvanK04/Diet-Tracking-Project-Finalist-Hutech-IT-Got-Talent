The two are related through their classification as side dishes, with a key contrast in dietary suitability—Caramen contains animal-derived ingredients and is not suitable for vegetarians or vegans, whereas Thạch Xanh is suitable for those following plant-based diets.

In the dessert context, it enhances texture and flavor through its rich, sticky consistency, contributing to the sensory experience of the dish. In the side dish form, it is prepared using eggs, milk, and sugar, resulting in a sweet, flavorful meal component that contains moderate carbohydrates and a small amount of protein. This dual functionality demonstrates its adaptability across different culinary traditions and meal types. However, the presence of animal-derived ingredients—specifically eggs and milk—makes Caramen incompatible with vegetarian and vegan diets. This dietary restriction is a critical consideration for consumers and food service providers.

Unlike Caramen, Thạch Xanh contains no animal products, making it suitable for vegetarians and vegans.

The dietary incompatibility of Caramen may limit its appeal in certain markets or institutions, such as schools, hospitals, or vegan restaurants.
