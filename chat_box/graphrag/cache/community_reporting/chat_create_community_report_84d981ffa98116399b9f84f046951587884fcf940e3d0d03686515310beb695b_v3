Selenium is identified as a potent antioxidant and essential cofactor in thyroid and immune function, with multiple food sources—such as cod, mackerel, tilapia, crab, and sunflower seeds—documented as containing selenium. The relationships show that selenium is directly linked to antioxidant activity and is found in both animal and plant-based foods. Additional nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and healthy fats are also interwoven with these food sources, forming a network of health-promoting dietary components.
