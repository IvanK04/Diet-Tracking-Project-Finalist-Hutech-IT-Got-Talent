The consistent use of coconut across multiple dishes suggests its importance in the culinary identity of the community.

The ingredient is valued for its neutral flavor and ability to complement a wide range of flavors without overpowering them. Its use in multiple dishes underscores its role as a foundational element in Vietnamese sweet cuisine.
