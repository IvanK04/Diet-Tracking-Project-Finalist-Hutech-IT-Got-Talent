It is explicitly applied to dishes such as Bánh mì thập cẩm, Bún nem cua bể, and Bánh tráng trộn, with measurable protein values like 30.6g per serving in Bánh mì thập cẩm. This category serves both as a health tag and a functional descriptor for individuals seeking muscle building, recovery, or increased protein intake. The consistency of its application across diverse dishes—ranging from noodle soups to offal-based meals—demonstrates a standardized and reliable nutritional classification system.

This specific nutritional value underscores its role in fitness and recovery diets. The dish is described as having moderate energy and high carbohydrates, indicating a balanced macronutrient profile. While it is not labeled as gluten-free or dairy-free, its protein content makes it a relevant option for individuals focused on muscle development. The high-protein designation is directly linked to its ingredients, including rare beef and herbs, which contribute to its nutritional value. This level of detail supports its use in health and wellness planning.

The dish includes ingredients like egg, pork, crab, and pork sausage, which contribute to its high protein and carbohydrate content. The gluten-free status is explicitly confirmed through its ingredient list, and the absence of dairy is inferred from the ingredient composition.

It is also characterized by high carbohydrate content, with a measured value of 69.9g of carbohydrates per serving, primarily from rice noodles. The dish is consistently described as gluten-free due to the use of rice noodles instead of wheat-based alternatives. While some descriptions note moderate energy levels, the high-carb nature of the meal makes it unsuitable for low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets. The dish is valued for its flavor, cultural significance, and balanced nutritional profile, making it a popular choice in social and communal dining settings.
