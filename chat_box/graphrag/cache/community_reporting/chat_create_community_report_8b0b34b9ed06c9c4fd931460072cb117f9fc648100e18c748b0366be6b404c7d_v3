It is consistently described as a precursor to vitamin A, playing a vital role in supporting eye health, immune function, and skin integrity. The presence of beta-carotene in these dishes underscores its importance in both traditional and modern nutritional frameworks. For instance, in Cá rô phi rán, beta-carotene content reaches 2850 µg per serving, while in Cháo lươn cay, it is present at 110,900 µg, which converts to vitamin A. These high concentrations highlight the dish's role as a nutrient-dense food. The nutrient is also found in plant-based sources such as sugarcane juice, pineapple juice, and pumpkin, indicating broad dietary origins.
