The dish is explicitly noted to contain allergens like peanuts and shrimp, and is flagged for high sodium, low fiber, and moderate energy. Relationships link the dish to allergens and health tags, though some connections are not clearly established due to missing ingredient data.

These allergens are significant because they can trigger severe allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. The dish also contains high levels of sodium, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular issues, especially in individuals with hypertension or heart conditions. This combination of allergens and high sodium content raises concerns about its safety for certain populations.

A lack of dietary fiber may contribute to poor bowel function and increased risk of gastrointestinal issues, while low protein content may affect muscle maintenance and overall energy balance. These deficiencies make the dish less suitable for individuals following balanced or health-focused diets. The nutritional profile is further compounded by its moderate energy level, which, while not excessive, does not support optimal daily energy needs for active individuals.

For example, the relationship between Nộm Bò Kho and the allergen 'ĐỘNG VẬT CÓ VỎ (TÔM, CUA)' is not directly supported by ingredient data, as no shrimp or crab-based ingredient is listed. Similarly, the link to 'NẤM' (mushroom) is not confirmed, as no mushroom-based ingredient is present. This lack of clear evidence raises concerns about the accuracy of allergen labeling and could lead to misinformed consumer decisions.

These tags are instead applied to other dishes, such as miến lươn trộn, which has high sodium and fat content. Since Nộm Bò Kho is described as low in cholesterol and fat, it does not meet the criteria for these tags. This indicates that the health risk profile of Nộm Bò Kho is distinct from other dishes and may be less harmful to heart health. However, the absence of these tags does not negate the risks from sodium and allergens.

This discrepancy between allergen listing and ingredient composition raises concerns about the accuracy of food labeling and allergen disclosure. Inaccurate allergen information can lead to serious health consequences, including anaphylaxis, especially in individuals with egg allergies. The lack of a clear link between the egg allergen and any ingredient in the dish suggests a potential error in data or labeling, which could have significant implications for food safety compliance.

This tag is intended to support stable energy levels throughout the day and aligns with general dietary guidelines. While Nộm Bò Kho is described as having moderate energy, this does not compensate for its other nutritional deficiencies or allergen risks. The tag serves as a positive descriptor for energy balance but does not mitigate the health risks associated with high sodium, low fiber, and allergens.

For instance, miến lươn trộn is tagged with HIGH_CHOLESTEROL, LOW_FIBER, and KHÔNG_TỐT_CHO_TIM_MẠCH, indicating a higher risk profile for heart health and digestion. In contrast, Nộm Bò Kho is not tagged with these risks, despite containing allergens. This suggests that the community's health risk profile is not uniformly distributed and that Nộm Bò Kho may be less dangerous in terms of chronic health conditions, though still risky for allergic individuals.

This lack of verifiable connections undermines the reliability of allergen disclosures and could lead to consumer harm. In the case of Nộm Bò Kho, the allergen list includes shrimp and peanuts, which are present in the ingredients, but the system does not clearly establish the connection.
