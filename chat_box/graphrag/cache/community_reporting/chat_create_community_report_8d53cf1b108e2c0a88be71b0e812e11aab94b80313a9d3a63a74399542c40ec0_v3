This ingredient contributes to the dish's rich flavor and protein content but also introduces a health risk for individuals with red meat allergies. The inclusion of red meat is explicitly stated in the description of the dish and is directly linked to allergenic concerns [Data: Entities (494), Relationships (889)]. This combination of nutritional value and allergenic content raises significant food safety implications, particularly in household or restaurant settings where individuals with known allergies may consume the dish without awareness. The presence of red meat in a staple meal suggests that allergen exposure is widespread and potentially unavoidable for many consumers, increasing the risk of allergic reactions in vulnerable populations.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"GIÁ ĐẬU XANH contains both ĐẬU PHỘNG and TÓI, two common allergens\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The ingredient GIÁ ĐẬU XANH is directly linked to the presence of both ĐẬU PHỘNG (peanuts) and TÓI (garlic), which are well-documented allergens. These components are explicitly mentioned in the relationships between entities, indicating that individuals with peanut or garlic allergies may experience adverse reactions when consuming dishes that include GIÁ ĐẬU XANH [Data: Relationships (78, 77, 79)]. While GIÁ ĐẬU XANH is primarily recognized as a green bean, its integration with allergenic ingredients underscores a critical food safety issue. The fact that these allergens are present in a commonly used ingredient across multiple dishes—such as Miến riêu cua (trộn), mỳ vằn thắn, and miến lươn trộn—means that the risk is not isolated to one meal but is systemic within Vietnamese cuisine. This increases the potential for widespread allergic reactions in communities where these dishes are regularly consumed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Multiple allergens co-occur in the same food items, increasing risk severity\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The relationships show that both ĐẬU PHỘNG and TÓI are present in the same dish (GIÁ ĐẬU XANH), and both are classified as allergens. Additionally, the relationship between TÓI and ĐẬU PHỘNG indicates that they may be present together in food items, which could lead to a compounded allergic response in sensitive individuals [Data: Relationships (79)]. This co-occurrence of allergens is particularly concerning because allergic reactions can be exacerbated when multiple allergens are consumed simultaneously. For individuals with cross-reactive sensitivities or multiple food allergies, the presence of these ingredients in a single dish significantly increases the likelihood of triggering a severe reaction. This pattern suggests that food safety protocols in kitchens and restaurants must account for the potential for multiple allergens to be present in one meal, especially in traditional dishes that are widely consumed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The dish is nutritionally balanced but poses allergen-related health risks\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Miến riêu cua (trộn) is described as a high-protein, balanced, and gluten-free meal with significant nutritional benefits, including high levels of protein, calcium, and potassium [Data: Entities (494)]. It is designed to support muscle maintenance and metabolic health, making it a staple in daily Vietnamese meals. However, this nutritional value is counterbalanced by the presence of allergens such as red meat, peanuts, and garlic. The dish's appeal as a nutritious and culturally significant meal makes it widely consumed, which amplifies the potential for allergic reactions. The combination of health benefits and allergenic content creates a complex risk profile: while the dish supports overall well-being, it may also endanger individuals with specific sensitivities. This duality underscores the need for better labeling and allergen disclosure in food service environments.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Allergen awareness is critical in food safety and dietary planning\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The presence of allergens such as ĐẬU PHỘNG and TÓI in commonly consumed dishes like GIÁ ĐẬU XANH and Miến riêu cua (trộn) necessitates heightened awareness among consumers, chefs, and food service providers. Although the allergens are not explicitly confirmed in all sources, they are consistently mentioned across multiple descriptions, indicating a shared understanding of their presence [Data: Entities (75, 77, 76), Relationships (78, 77, 79)]. This suggests that allergen risks are not hypothetical but are embedded in traditional food practices. Consumers, especially those with known allergies, must be informed about these ingredients to avoid adverse health outcomes.

While these ingredients are valued for their flavor and cultural significance, their inclusion in staple dishes like Miến riêu cua (trộn) and GIÁ ĐẬU XANH may unintentionally expose a broad population to allergens. The descriptions highlight that these ingredients are not only present but are integral to the dish's texture and taste, making them difficult to remove without altering the dish's identity [Data: Entities (494, 75), Relationships (78, 77)].
