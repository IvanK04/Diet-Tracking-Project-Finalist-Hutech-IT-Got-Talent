It is described as a plant-based fat rich in monounsaturated fats and polyphenols, which contribute to cardiovascular well-being. The oil's benefits are specifically tied to reducing inflammation, protecting against oxidative stress, and improving endothelial function. These mechanisms are supported by detailed scientific claims that link olive oil consumption to reduced risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

The relationship between olive oil and heart health states that it helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol while preserving or increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. This balanced lipid profile is critical in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the polyphenols in olive oil—such as oleocanthal and oleuropein—are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which protect the cardiovascular system from oxidative damage. These benefits are especially pronounced when olive oil is consumed in its unrefined, extra virgin form, as processing can degrade beneficial compounds.

Olive oil is explicitly linked to high antioxidant levels through its polyphenols and vitamin E, which combat oxidative stress in the body. Clementines are also noted for their antioxidant content, particularly vitamin C, and are connected to the high-antioxidants concept. This suggests a broader dietary pattern where multiple foods contribute to antioxidant intake. The presence of these compounds is tied to cellular protection and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

Sunflower oil is noted for its high smoke point and natural vitamin E content, which supports heart health and acts as an antioxidant. Peanut oil is similarly linked to heart health due to its monounsaturated fats and vitamin E. However, these connections are less detailed and less emphasized than those of olive oil. While both oils are beneficial, their roles are more limited to specific cooking applications and general nutrient profiles. Sunflower oil's high smoke point makes it suitable for frying, which may influence dietary choices in high-temperature cooking.
