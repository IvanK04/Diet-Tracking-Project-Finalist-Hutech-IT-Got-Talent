These differences suggest distinct nutritional profiles and potential target audiences. For example, the presence of iron and magnesium in watermelon juice may appeal to individuals with specific dietary needs, such as those with anemia or low mineral intake. In contrast, orange juice is traditionally known for its high vitamin C, which supports immune function. These distinctions are important for nutritional labeling and consumer education.
