This dish is explicitly linked to multiple health benefits, including muscle development, energy recovery, and bone and joint health, due to its rich content of calcium and potassium. It is also directly associated with a high-protein diet, positioning it as a key food choice for individuals seeking to build or repair muscle. The dish's nutritional profile—high in protein, low in carbohydrates, and rich in essential minerals—makes it a versatile and effective component of various dietary regimens.

The relationships between protein and various health outcomes—such as muscle development, energy recovery, and immune function—highlight its foundational role in nutritional science. This widespread presence of protein across both animal and plant-based sources demonstrates a broad understanding of dietary needs and reinforces the centrality of protein in health-focused food choices.

Chicken hearts contribute to vision and immune health through vitamin A, while frozen shrimp and yellowfin tuna provide essential vitamins and minerals such as selenium and B12. These nutrient-specific claims demonstrate a detailed understanding of how food components contribute to physiological outcomes. The integration of vitamins and minerals into health claims shows a nuanced approach to nutritional analysis, emphasizing not just protein but the synergistic effects of micronutrients.

Similarly, foods like oatmeal, sunflower seeds, and chia seeds are associated with heart health through their high fiber, omega-3s, and potassium content. These connections illustrate how food selection can align with specific health goals. While the keto diet is described as low-carb rather than zero-carb, the inclusion of keto-friendly dishes shows a practical application of nutritional principles in real-world diets.
