It is found in a wide range of food sources, including egg yolk, paprika, pork sausages, and traditional dishes like Nộm bò khô and Cháo lươn cay. The consistent emphasis across all descriptions on its essential biological functions—vision, immunity, and skin integrity—demonstrates a unified and scientifically grounded understanding of its role in human health. This widespread presence in both plant-based and animal-based foods underscores its accessibility and importance in diverse diets.

The relationship between egg yolk and vitamin A is explicitly stated in the text, emphasizing that egg yolk is a 'rich source' of vitamin A, which supports vision and immune function. This is further reinforced by the presence of other nutrients like vitamin D, E, K, and B12 in the yolk, which contribute to overall health. The emulsifying properties of lecithin in egg yolk also support its culinary utility, making it a valuable ingredient in both traditional and modern food preparation. The nutritional synergy between egg yolk and vitamin A positions it as a foundational component in balanced diets, particularly for individuals with vision or immune health needs.

The text consistently highlights its nutritional value, noting that it is derived from *Capsicum annuum* and contains natural antioxidants and vitamin A. This makes paprika not only a flavor enhancer but also a health-promoting ingredient in food preparation. Its use in a variety of dishes—such as sauces, soups, and baked goods—demonstrates its broad applicability and integration into global cuisines. The absence of contradictory claims or inconsistencies in the descriptions supports a reliable and consistent portrayal of paprika's role in nutrition.

While the text does not provide detailed nutritional breakdowns, it explicitly links pork sausages to vitamin A, aligning with the broader nutritional narrative of the community. This connection suggests that processed meat products can also serve as contributors to essential micronutrient intake. However, the text does not elaborate on the concentration or bioavailability of vitamin A in pork sausages, which limits the depth of this relationship. Still, the presence of this link reinforces the idea that vitamin A is distributed across a variety of food groups, including animal-based products.

For vision, vitamin A is directly linked to maintaining proper night vision and eye health. For skin health, it is explicitly stated that vitamin A supports skin integrity, which is essential for wound healing and barrier function. In terms of immune function, vitamin A is described as bolstering the body’s defenses against infections. These functions are consistently referenced across multiple relationships and descriptions, indicating a well-supported and coherent nutritional framework. The absence of conflicting data or contradictory claims strengthens the reliability of this information.

For example, one serving of Nộm bò khô contains 701.7 µg of vitamin A, while another dish contains a higher amount of 2884 µg. This variation is attributed to differences in food preparation, source, and ingredient concentration. While the exact reasons for these differences are not fully detailed, the text acknowledges that such variability is normal and expected in nutritional science. This variability highlights the importance of considering food context when assessing vitamin A intake. It also suggests that dietary recommendations should account for preparation methods and ingredient sourcing.
