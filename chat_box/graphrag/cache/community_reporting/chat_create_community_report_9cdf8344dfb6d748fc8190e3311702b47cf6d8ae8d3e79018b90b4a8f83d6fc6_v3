Mango is linked to seasonal patterns in Southeast Asia, where its consumption aligns with summer and early autumn, and is associated with the presence of amylase, a digestive enzyme. Additionally, mango is a natural source of riboflavin and niacin, which support energy metabolism, skin health, and digestive function. The relationships between these entities highlight a network of nutritional, agricultural, and biological interdependencies that are central to tropical food systems and human health.\",\n    \"rating\": 2.0,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is low because the community consists of nutritional and agricultural facts with no indication of legal, operational, or social risks or threats.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mango is seasonally available during warm months\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mango is primarily available during the warmer months, especially in summer and early autumn, which aligns with seasonal fruit consumption patterns in Southeast Asia and other tropical regions. This seasonal availability is a key factor in agricultural planning, dietary habits, and cultural practices in these areas. The timing of mango availability is directly tied to temperature and daylight cycles, which influence fruit growth and harvest. This pattern is supported by the relationship between Mango and SEASONS, indicating that mango consumption is part of a broader seasonal rhythm in tropical food systems [Data: Relationships (1188)]. The warm months provide optimal conditions for mango growth, and this timing is consistent across multiple sources, reinforcing its role in seasonal food cycles. As such, the seasonal nature of mango consumption shapes both supply chains and consumer behavior in tropical regions, making it a foundational element in regional food culture and planning.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mango contains amylase, a digestive enzyme\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mango naturally contains amylase, an enzyme that aids in the breakdown of starches during digestion. This biological property contributes to the fruit's role in supporting digestive health and is a key reason for its inclusion in various culinary preparations. The presence of amylase in mango is explicitly documented in the relationship between Mango and DIGESTIVE ENZYMES, highlighting its functional significance in human nutrition [Data: Relationships (1164)]. This enzyme helps initiate the digestion of complex carbohydrates, making mango a beneficial food for individuals with mild digestive challenges. While the enzyme content is moderate compared to other sources, its presence in a widely consumed fruit makes it a notable component of dietary support. The fact that amylase is naturally present in mango without requiring supplementation underscores its value as a natural digestive aid in traditional and modern diets.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mango is a natural source of riboflavin (B2)\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mango is a dietary source of riboflavin (B2), a water-soluble B vitamin essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant defense. Riboflavin acts as a cofactor in metabolic reactions that convert food into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body’s primary energy currency. It also supports the synthesis of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are critical in redox reactions throughout the body [Data: Entities (601), Relationships (1118)]. The presence of riboflavin in mango, along with coconut, makes it a valuable component of plant-based diets that emphasize metabolic health. While the concentration may be moderate, its bioavailability and natural origin enhance its role in promoting overall well-being. Deficiency in riboflavin can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, skin disorders, and impaired growth, emphasizing the importance of consistent dietary intake of such nutrients [Data: Entities (601)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mango is a source of niacin (B3), supporting skin and digestive health\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mango contains niacin (B3), a B vitamin that plays a vital role in energy metabolism, skin integrity, and gastrointestinal function. Niacin supports the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, contributing to efficient energy production and cellular health. It also helps maintain the skin barrier, reducing dryness and other dermatological issues, and supports mucosal health in the digestive tract [Data: Entities (602), Relationships (1120)]. This nutrient is naturally present in mango and coconut, making it accessible through a balanced, tropical diet. The connection between niacin and digestive health is particularly relevant in tropical regions where dietary patterns are closely tied to seasonal availability of fruits. While niacin is not the primary nutrient in mango, its presence adds to the fruit’s overall nutritional profile and supports multiple physiological functions [Data: Entities (602), Relationships (1120)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The community reflects a network of nutritional and seasonal interdependencies\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The entities in this community—Mango, SEASONS, DIGESTIVE ENZYMES, riboflavin (B2), and niacin (B3)—form a coherent network of biological and agricultural interdependencies.
