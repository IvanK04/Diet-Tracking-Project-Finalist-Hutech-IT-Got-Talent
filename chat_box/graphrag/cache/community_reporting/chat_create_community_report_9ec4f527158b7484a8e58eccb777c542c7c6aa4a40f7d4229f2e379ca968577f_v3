The entity 'Protein' is directly linked to a wide range of food items including peanut butter, boneless pork chop, pork ears, endosperm, roasted red beans, and dried red beans, indicating its broad presence in both animal and plant-based diets. This widespread distribution underscores protein's role as a cornerstone of balanced nutrition.

For instance, meat is explicitly described as rich in iron and B vitamins, supporting oxygen transport and immune function [Data: Relationships (2432, 2438, 2436)]. Pork ears are noted for their protein and collagen content, which supports skin and joint health. These relationships highlight the importance of animal proteins in meeting dietary needs, particularly for muscle development and metabolic health.

While lean cuts like boneless pork chop and hog meat are emphasized for their low saturated fat and high protein content, other cuts like pork shoulder are noted for their high collagen and fat content, making them better suited for slow-cooked dishes. This suggests that the community recognizes the diversity in protein sources and their suitability for different dietary goals.

Mộc nhĩ khô is particularly noted for its extremely high iron content, supporting blood health and digestion [Data: Relationships (2451)]. These foods are positioned as accessible, culturally relevant, and nutritionally valuable alternatives to animal proteins, especially for individuals following plant-based or vegan lifestyles.

Vitamin B12 is notably present in fish such as cá rô sống and cá chạch, which are described as supporting nervous system function [Data: Relationships (2452, 2447)]. Iodine is specifically linked to cá chạch and cá rô sống, supporting thyroid and nervous system health [Data: Relationships (2448, 1172)].

For example, the link between fish and vitamin B12 is particularly important because B12 deficiency is common in vegetarians and vegans, making fish a critical dietary recommendation. Similarly, iodine deficiency can lead to goiter and cognitive impairments, so the identification of iodine-rich foods like cá chạch is clinically relevant.
