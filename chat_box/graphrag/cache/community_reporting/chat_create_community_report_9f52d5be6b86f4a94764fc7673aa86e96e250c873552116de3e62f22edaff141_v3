It is described as a plant used as a primary ingredient in making sugarcane juice and is directly linked to the production of nước mía through a clear ingredient relationship. This foundational role suggests that any changes in sugarcane availability or cultivation could ripple through the entire network.

This nutritional profile makes it a significant component in energy-dense diets, particularly in traditional or regional cuisines. Its high carbohydrate content is directly attributed to its sugarcane content, which is a key point of connection in the community. This characteristic may influence consumer behavior and dietary choices, especially in contexts where energy intake is prioritized.

This relationship highlights the culinary use of sugar in traditional Vietnamese desserts, where it plays a functional and sensory role. The presence of this ingredient link suggests that sugar is not only a raw material but also a functional component in food preparation.

These relationships form a logical food production and consumption pathway, where raw material (sugarcane) is transformed into intermediate products (sugar and nước mía) that are then used in specific dishes.
