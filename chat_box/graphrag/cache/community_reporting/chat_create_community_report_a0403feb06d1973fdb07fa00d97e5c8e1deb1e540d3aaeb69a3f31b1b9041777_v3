Dưa chuột muối is also noted as being used in both Cơm rang and Cơm rang dưa bò, suggesting a broader culinary application. The pickling process may introduce preservatives or fermentation byproducts, which could be of concern in certain dietary restrictions (e.g., for individuals with digestive sensitivities).
