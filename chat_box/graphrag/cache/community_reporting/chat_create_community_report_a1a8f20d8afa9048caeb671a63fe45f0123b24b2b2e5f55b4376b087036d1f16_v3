The entity 'Raw' is present but lacks a description, and no direct relationships connect it to Tilapia or protein.

It is recognized as a flexible, low-mercury protein source, making it a popular choice in health-conscious diets. This nutritional profile positions Tilapia as a key player in discussions about healthy eating and sustainable protein sources. The entity has a high degree of connectivity, with two significant relationships: one to protein and one to low saturated fat, reinforcing its role in nutritional science.

This makes it a favorable alternative to other animal proteins, especially for individuals managing cardiovascular health or seeking low-mercury dietary options. The relationship between Tilapia and protein (ID: 2072) underscores its value in nutritional frameworks. This claim is supported by multiple data points and aligns with public health recommendations for balanced diets. The low saturated fat content is particularly relevant in reducing the risk of heart disease, which is a major public health concern.

Saturated fats are known to raise LDL cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. By contrast, Tilapia's low saturated fat content makes it a suitable option for individuals managing cholesterol or following a heart-healthy diet. This nutritional attribute is a key reason for its inclusion in dietary guidelines and health education materials.

While Salmon is noted as being consumed in raw form (e.g., in sashimi or ceviche), this information is not linked to Tilapia. This suggests that the community does not currently include raw consumption as a feature of Tilapia. The absence of a relationship between Tilapia and raw form implies that Tilapia is not typically consumed raw, which differentiates it from other fish like salmon. This distinction is important for dietary recommendations and food safety considerations.
