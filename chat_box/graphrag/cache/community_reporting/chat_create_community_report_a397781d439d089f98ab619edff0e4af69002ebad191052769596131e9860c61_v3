Háo Cảo Hấp is categorized as a side dish and is directly linked to the ingredient Bột Mì (wheat flour), and is also classified under the món phụ category. The presence of pork in the dish raises potential allergen risks, despite the dish being labeled as non-allergenic. The community's structure reflects a chain of culinary and nutritional relationships, with implications for food safety and consumer health.

It contains cholesterol, has low fiber, and high sodium, and is not a source of vitamin A or vitamin C. This composition places it within a category of processed side dishes that may be consumed in Vietnamese cuisine. The dish is directly linked to the ingredient Bột Mì through a component relationship, indicating that wheat flour is a foundational ingredient in its preparation. This relationship is critical in understanding the nutritional and allergenic profile of the dish.

This information is directly relevant to Háo Cảo Hấp, which contains pork. While the dish itself is labeled as non-allergenic, the presence of pork as a listed allergen introduces a potential health risk for sensitive individuals. This creates a tension between the dish's classification and the allergen data, which may lead to confusion or mislabeling in food safety contexts. The allergen claim is supported by the description of THỊT HEO and its general presence in food items.

This indicates that wheat flour is essential to the dish's structure and flavor profile. The ingredient is used in a standard culinary context, and its inclusion supports the dish's classification as a side dish. The relationship between Bột Mì and Háo Cảo Hấp is well-documented and forms a foundational link in the community's structure.

This classification is consistent with its nutritional profile and preparation method. The categorization supports the understanding that it is a supporting element in a meal, which may influence consumer expectations and portioning. This classification is reinforced by its relationship with the món phụ category, which is a structural element in the community.

This contradiction between ingredient content and allergen status raises concerns about food safety communication. Consumers with pork allergies may be misled by this labeling, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes. The lack of clear allergen disclosure in the dish's description undermines trust in food labeling systems and may require regulatory review. This discrepancy is supported by the presence of THỊT HEO as an allergen and its inclusion in the dish.
