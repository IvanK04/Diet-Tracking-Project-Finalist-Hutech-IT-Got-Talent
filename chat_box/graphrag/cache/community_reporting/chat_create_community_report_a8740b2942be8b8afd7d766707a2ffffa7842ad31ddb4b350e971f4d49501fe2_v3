Tapioca Flour is described as a gluten-free starch derived from cassava, containing manganese and being vegan-friendly. Sò Điệp is a lean seafood rich in protein and vitamin B12, classified as a soft-bodied animal. The entities are connected through nutritional and biological relationships, including Tapioca Flour's derivation from a plant (not a soft-bodied animal) and Sò Điệp's classification as a lean seafood source with high-quality nutrients.

It is commonly used in baking and sauces to provide texture and thickness. This attribute makes it particularly suitable for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Additionally, tapioca flour is explicitly described as vegan-friendly, meaning it contains no animal products and is appropriate for vegan diets. These characteristics position it as a key ingredient in health-conscious and dietary-specific food products.

It is classified as a lean seafood source, meaning it provides essential nutrients with minimal fat, making it a healthy dietary option. It is particularly rich in vitamin B12, which plays a critical role in neurological function and red blood cell formation. This nutritional profile makes it a valuable component in balanced diets, especially for populations with B12 deficiencies.

This distinction is critical in understanding the biological and nutritional origins of the two entities. The relationship between Tapioca Flour and Soft-Bodied Animal explicitly states that tapioca flour is not derived from a soft-bodied animal, reinforcing its plant-based origin.
