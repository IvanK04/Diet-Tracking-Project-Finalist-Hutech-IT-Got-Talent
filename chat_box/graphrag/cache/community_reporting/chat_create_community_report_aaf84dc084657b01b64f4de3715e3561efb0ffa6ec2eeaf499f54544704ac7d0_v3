In contrast, white flour is refined, removing these components and resulting in a lower nutritional profile. This nutritional distinction is a key point in the relationship between the two entities and supports the claim that whole wheat flour offers health benefits over white flour.

This makes it better suited for whole grain breads, pancakes, and cookies. The texture and flavor profile are important considerations for bakers and consumers seeking different taste and consistency experiences.

This refinement process leads to a more consistent texture and milder flavor, making it popular in commercial baking. However, the loss of nutrients raises concerns about long-term dietary health, especially in populations relying heavily on refined grains.
