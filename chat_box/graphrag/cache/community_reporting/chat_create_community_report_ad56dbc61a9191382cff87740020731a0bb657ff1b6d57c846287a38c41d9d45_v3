In its side dish form, it is made with eggs and milk, making it unsuitable for vegetarians or vegans. This dual functionality underscores its adaptability across Vietnamese cuisine. However, its animal-based composition introduces significant allergens, including dairy and eggs, which must be disclosed to consumers with sensitivities. The presence of these allergens is critical for individuals with dietary restrictions, particularly those managing allergies or following plant-based diets.
