It supports skin health, immune function, and cellular integrity, and is found in diverse dietary sources such as almonds, sunflower seeds, salmon, and oils like peanut and coconut oil. The comprehensive description across multiple data points confirms its role as a vital nutrient with consistent scientific backing. This foundational role positions Vitamin E as a key component in public health discussions around nutrition and cellular protection.

They are described as a plant-based food product and are associated with high selenium content and plant-based protein. These attributes are explicitly documented in the relationships: sunflower seeds are rich in selenium [Data: Relationships (1823)] and are a good source of plant-based protein [Data: Relationships (1824)]. Additionally, they are nutritionally comparable to carp ro phi, a fish-based food, in terms of protein and vitamin content. This suggests that sunflower seeds serve as a versatile, accessible, and nutritionally valuable food option. Their presence in both plant-based and comparative nutritional contexts reinforces their importance in dietary planning and public health education.

It is directly linked to carp ro phi in a relationship that highlights their shared nutritional profile, particularly in terms of omega-3s and protein content, despite differing origins and preparation methods. This comparison suggests that both are considered valuable in diets focused on heart health and muscle development. The relationship between Atlantic salmon and carp ro phi underscores a broader trend in nutritional comparisons between animal and plant-based sources. While Atlantic salmon is not directly linked to Vitamin E, it is part of a larger nutritional ecosystem where omega-3s and antioxidants are valued.

This health tag, labeled as 'Giàu selenium', is directly linked to sunflower seeds through a specific relationship [Data: Relationships (1823)]. Selenium is a key nutrient in human health, and its presence in sunflower seeds enhances their nutritional value. The Vietnamese phrase 'Vitamin E là một chất chống oxy hóa có mặt trong dầu mè và dầu dừa' further supports the idea that these oils—commonly used in cooking—contain both vitamin E and selenium, reinforcing the dietary accessibility of these nutrients. This connection makes sunflower seeds a valuable source of multiple micronutrients.

This is explicitly stated in the relationship between sunflower seeds and the health tag 'Giàu protein thực vật' [Data: Relationships (1824)]. This makes them a valuable alternative to animal-based protein sources, especially in populations seeking plant-based nutrition. The presence of this attribute supports their role in promoting sustainable and health-conscious eating patterns. While the overall community lacks any indication of commercial or operational risk, the emphasis on plant-based nutrition aligns with growing public health trends.

This relationship [Data: Relationships (1319)] suggests that processed meats can also contribute to vitamin E intake, although in smaller quantities compared to natural food sources. While this may be relevant for dietary balance, it does not imply any health risk or negative consequence. The inclusion of pork sausage in the community highlights the diversity of food sources where vitamin E can be found, even in processed forms. However, the absence of any claims about health risks or regulatory issues related to pork sausage indicates that this connection remains neutral and educational in nature.

While not directly connected to vitamin E or the other core entities, this relationship introduces a broader nutritional theme of healthy fats [Data: Relationships (1028)]. This suggests that the community may be part of a larger nutritional framework focused on fats and their health benefits. However, avocado is not directly tied to vitamin E or selenium, and its inclusion is more peripheral. The connection to healthy fats reinforces the importance of dietary fats in overall health, but does not significantly expand the core relationships within the community.
