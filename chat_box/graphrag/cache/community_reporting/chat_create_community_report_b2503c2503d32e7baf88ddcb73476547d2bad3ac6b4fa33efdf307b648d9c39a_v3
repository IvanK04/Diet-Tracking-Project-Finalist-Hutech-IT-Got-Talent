This classification is foundational to understanding its culinary and nutritional role. The relationship between Su Hao and the cabbage family is directly supported by the data, indicating a taxonomic and biological connection.

This implies that Su Hao is part of a larger group of nutritious plants that are commonly consumed and valued for their health-promoting properties. The shared characteristics of the cabbage family—such as high fiber content, vitamin richness, and low calorie density—suggest that Su Hao is not unique in its benefits but rather representative of a broader category of healthy foods.

While the data does not establish a direct pathway from Su Hao to vitamin A, the combined nutritional profile suggests that Su Hao can play a supportive role in immune function. This indirect support is grounded in the known health benefits of the nutrients it contains.
