This attribute is not limited to animal-based sources, as it also appears in traditional beverages like cà phê trứng, demonstrating its broad applicability in nutritional contexts. The presence of GIÀU_PROTEIN across diverse food categories—ranging from seafood to traditional drinks—suggests it serves as a reliable indicator of nutritional quality and supports muscle maintenance, immune function, and satiety. This widespread occurrence makes it a foundational element in dietary planning and health education.

The protein content in these items supports muscle preservation during weight reduction, aligning with nutritional science principles. Additionally, Tôm đông lạnh is noted to support weight loss due to its high protein and low fat content, reinforcing its role in dietary strategies for metabolic balance. These foods are also valued for their omega-3 fatty acids and essential amino acids, contributing to overall health beyond just weight management.

The dietary strategy emphasizes nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods that support satiety and metabolic balance. While not a medical diagnosis, GIAM_CAN reflects a practical and culturally relevant approach to wellness in Vietnamese health practices. The inclusion of traditional foods like ca tim (a leafy green) further demonstrates how cultural dietary habits are adapted to modern health goals.
