Nước chanh leo contains 66 calories and 15.6g of carbohydrates, while nước ép dưa hấu has 85.1 calories and is rich in iron, magnesium, and vitamin C. Nước trà hoa cúc is particularly low in calories (18.3), with no fat and very low energy, making it ideal for metabolic support. These drinks are promoted for their nutrient density and low caloric content, aligning with the overall goal of reducing overall energy intake. The consistent categorization of these beverages under GIẢM_CÂN indicates a deliberate effort to integrate hydration and nutrition into a weight-loss regimen.
