The beverage's detailed composition—228.8 calories, 8.7 grams of protein, 8.7 grams of carbs, 17.7 grams of fat—provides a clear profile of its nutritional profile. This level of detail suggests the community is focused on health and dietary information rather than any operational or social activity.

This attribute is directly linked to the drink's nutritional profile and is one of the primary descriptors of its composition. The high fat content is noted in the context of its overall caloric and macronutrient makeup, which may influence dietary recommendations or consumer choices. This attribute is also associated with potential health considerations, such as cardiovascular implications, though no clinical or health risk assessments are provided.

The protein content (8.7 grams) is significant in dietary contexts, especially for athletes or individuals recovering from physical activity.

Potassium is important for muscle function and blood pressure regulation, while vitamin A supports immune function and vision. The presence of these nutrients suggests the drink may be marketed as a health-promoting beverage. However, the data does not indicate any clinical benefits, risks, or regulatory scrutiny related to these nutrients.

The high fat and high protein content may also contribute to a longer-lasting energy effect, though no evidence is provided on user experience or metabolic effects. The drink's classification under 'đồ uống' (drink) and its inclusion of multiple health tags suggests a structured nutritional database rather than a social or operational network.
