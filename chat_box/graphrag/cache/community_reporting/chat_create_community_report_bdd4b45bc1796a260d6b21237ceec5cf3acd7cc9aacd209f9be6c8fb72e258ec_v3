Mì chính (fermented seasoning paste) contributes a deep umami and savory depth, amplifying the natural flavors of the ingredients. These components are interdependent: the dish's identity is built on the synergy between the savory meat, the sour vegetables, and the umami seasoning. The relationships between these elements are well-documented and consistent across descriptions, showing a clear functional and culinary logic.
