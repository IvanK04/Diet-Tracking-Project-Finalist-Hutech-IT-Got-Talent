It contains no fat or protein and is free of allergens, which makes it accessible and safe for most individuals. Its primary nutritional value comes from natural sugars, which provide a rapid source of energy, ideal for active lifestyles or short-term energy boosts. However, due to its high sugar content, it is not recommended for individuals managing low-energy or low-carbohydrate diets, as it may contribute to elevated blood sugar levels and metabolic strain if consumed excessively. The drink is specifically categorized under 'giữ_cân' (weight-maintenance), indicating its role in supporting energy balance without promoting weight gain.

It is rich in essential nutrients such as vitamin C, beta-carotene, potassium, and trace minerals like zinc and magnesium. These components support immune function, eye health, and blood pressure regulation. Unlike NƯỚC MÍA, it contains a more balanced nutrient profile with complex carbohydrates and beneficial phytonutrients, which may offer better long-term health outcomes. However, it contains bromelain, an enzyme naturally present in papaya that can act as an allergen for sensitive individuals. While bromelain has anti-inflammatory properties in dietary supplements, it may trigger allergic reactions in those with known sensitivities. Therefore, consumption should be cautious for such individuals. The drink is not classified as a weight-loss beverage, as this claim is unsupported by nutritional data and appears to be a misattribution.

However, this classification should be interpreted with caution, as the high sugar content in both drinks—especially in concentrated forms—can contribute to increased caloric intake, insulin resistance, and long-term metabolic challenges if consumed regularly without dietary balance. The shared categorization reflects a common use in daily routines where energy is needed, but it does not imply health benefits or suitability for all individuals.

In contrast, NƯỚC ÉP DỨA contains more complex carbohydrates and beneficial phytonutrients, offering a more gradual energy release and better support for immune and digestive health. Its lower glycemic impact makes it a potentially more favorable option for individuals managing blood glucose levels. Nutritionally, NƯỚC ÉP DỨA offers higher levels of vitamin C and beta-carotene, contributing to antioxidant activity and eye health. These differences suggest that NƯỚC ÉP DỨA may be a more health-conscious choice for regular consumption, while NƯỚC MÍA is better suited as an occasional energy source.
