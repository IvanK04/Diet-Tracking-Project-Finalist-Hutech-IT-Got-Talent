This function is consistently described across multiple food sources and is central to the health benefits attributed to various plant-based foods. Antioxidants are linked to improved immune function, reduced chronic inflammation, and cellular protection, making them a foundational element in preventive health strategies. The entity's high degree (26) indicates it is a central hub in the network, connecting to multiple food sources and health outcomes.

This relationship directly ties clementines to the antioxidant network, reinforcing their role in supporting health through nutrient intake. The high combined degree of this relationship (37) suggests that clementines are a notable dietary contributor to antioxidant benefits. This connection also aligns with broader dietary balance principles, as vitamin C supports immune and cellular health.
