FAT is a macronutrient essential for energy and cellular function, found in diverse foods including peanut butter and traditional dishes. COOKING OIL is a primary source of dietary fat, used widely in culinary applications and varying in nutritional profile based on plant source. WHITE SUGAR is a refined carbohydrate source with high energy content and minimal nutrients, commonly used as a sweetener.

It is present in a wide range of foods, including peanut butter, fish, seeds, and traditional dishes such as miến lươn trộn and nộm bò kho. The primary form of fat in peanut butter is unsaturated fat, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health due to its ability to reduce bad cholesterol and support healthy blood pressure. In contrast, saturated fats—commonly found in animal products and processed foods—are associated with increased health risks when consumed in excess. This distinction underscores the importance of dietary fat quality over quantity. The presence of fat in traditional meals indicates that even in culturally specific dishes, fat is a measurable and intentional component of nutritional balance.

It is derived from plant sources and is used in frying, sautéing, and other cooking methods due to its high heat tolerance and neutral flavor. The nutritional value of cooking oil depends on its source—such as sunflower, olive, or flaxseed—determining its omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. Oils rich in omega-3, like flaxseed or canola, offer greater health benefits compared to those high in omega-6, such as corn or soybean oil. Cooking oil is also allergen-prone, with potential allergens including sesame, soy, mung beans, and peanuts, depending on the source. This variability makes ingredient transparency critical for consumers with allergies.

It contains 8.28 calories per 100 grams, with 2.07 grams of carbohydrates and no protein or fat, classifying it as a calorie-dense, empty-calorie food. While it contains trace minerals such as calcium, iron, and potassium, these are present in minimal amounts and do not contribute meaningfully to dietary needs. White sugar is categorized under oils and seasonings and is allergen-free, making it suitable for individuals with common food allergies. However, its high carbohydrate content and lack of essential vitamins make it a concern when consumed in excess, particularly due to its impact on blood sugar levels. It is often used as a sweetener in coffee, linking it to coffee beans.

While FAT supports long-term health when derived from unsaturated sources, WHITE SUGAR provides a rapid energy source that can lead to blood sugar spikes if consumed in excess. This imbalance may contribute to metabolic issues such as insulin resistance or obesity when dietary patterns favor high-carbohydrate, low-fiber, and high-sugar intake. The emphasis on unsaturated fats in peanut butter and plant-based oils promotes a health-conscious dietary approach, while the use of white sugar as a sweetener in coffee and other foods reflects common but potentially unhealthy consumption habits. Nutritional guidelines stress moderation and the selection of healthier fat types, reinforcing the need for mindful dietary choices.

This allergen variability is a critical consideration in food safety and labeling practices. The relationship between Cooking Oil and Allergen indicates that consumers must carefully check product labels to avoid adverse reactions. While the allergen list is not exhaustive and may vary by processing or sourcing, the presence of common allergens in certain oils underscores the importance of transparency in food manufacturing.
