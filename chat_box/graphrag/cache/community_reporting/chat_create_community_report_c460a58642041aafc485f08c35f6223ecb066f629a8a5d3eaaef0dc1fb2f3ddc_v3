It is described as a main meal composed of glass noodles, crispy eel, green beans, cucumber, crushed garlic, and roasted peanuts, with garnishes of rau kinh giới. The dish is nutritionally balanced with 308.8 calories, 8.5g protein, and 54.9g carbohydrates, and is classified as a weight-maintenance meal. It is also noted for being rich in vitamin A and high in sodium, which may pose health risks for individuals managing diabetes or cardiovascular conditions. The dish's allergenic profile includes peanuts, fish (from eel), and garlic, making it unsuitable for those with sensitivities. This central role is supported by its extensive ingredient list and its connections to multiple other dishes in the network.

This contradiction suggests a potential data entry or labeling error in the system. In the context of Vietnamese cuisine, eel is a valued ingredient, and its use in Miến lươn trộn provides a crunchy texture and savory flavor. The reference to FOOD_220 as a herb in Cháo lươn cay is likely a misattribution, possibly confusing it with lemongrass or galangal, which are common in eel stews. The most coherent interpretation is that FOOD_220 refers to a prepared form of eel, specifically crispy eel, used in noodle-based dishes. This clarification is essential for accurate culinary documentation and ingredient tracking. The inconsistency highlights a need for improved data standardization in food databases.

Miến lươn trộn contains roasted peanuts, eel (a fish allergen), and crushed garlic—all of which can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. The presence of eel also raises potential shellfish-related concerns, though this is less directly supported. The dish is also high in sodium and low in dietary fiber, which may be problematic for individuals with diabetes or heart health concerns. These allergens are explicitly listed in the descriptions, and their presence in multiple dishes (e.g., Miến lươn nước) suggests a broader risk across the community. While the dishes are generally safe for most consumers, they require careful labeling and consumer warnings. This information is critical for food safety and labeling compliance in commercial or home settings.

In Miến lươn trộn, it is associated with carrot, contributing texture and color. In Cháo đỗ xanh and Cháo lươn cay, it is linked to white sugar, used as a flavor enhancer. This dual usage suggests a data categorization error—FOOD_029 may be a system identifier rather than a specific ingredient. Such inconsistencies can lead to mislabeling, incorrect nutritional reporting, and confusion in recipe development. Resolving this requires a standardized taxonomy for food ingredients. Without clarification, FOOD_029 remains ambiguous and may compromise the accuracy of nutritional and allergen assessments.
