It is explicitly described as containing high levels of vitamin C and other B vitamins, including pantothenic acid. This dual nutritional profile positions Pomelo as a key dietary component in discussions about vitamin intake. The relationships indicate that Pomelo is not only a fruit but a functional food with multiple health benefits.

This characteristic supports its role in promoting immune function and overall wellness. The nutritional profile of Pomelo is directly tied to its use in dietary recommendations, especially in contexts emphasizing healthy, low-calorie food options. The fact that it is rich in vitamin C and low in calories suggests it may be recommended in weight management or preventive health programs.

This connection is explicitly stated in the data, showing that Pomelo is a natural source of this nutrient. Pantothenic acid plays a critical role in metabolic processes, including the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates, and is vital for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nerve function. The presence of B5 in Pomelo enhances its nutritional value and broadens its appeal in dietary planning.

However, there is no direct relationship between folate and Pomelo. This indicates that folate is part of a separate nutritional network, centered on peanut-based foods. The absence of a connection between folate and Pomelo suggests that the community is not a unified nutritional ecosystem but rather a collection of related but distinct food-nutrient associations.

This relationship is distinct from the Pomelo-based network and shows that biotin is primarily sourced from animal-based foods. There is no mention of biotin in Pomelo or any other fruit in the dataset.
