These dishes are interconnected through shared nutritional attributes—particularly high protein—and allergen profiles. Relationships highlight commonalities in protein content, dietary suitability, and allergens, with some dishes differing in health claims such as heart health, muscle support, or calcium content. Notably, several dishes contain allergens like fish, shrimp, eggs, or gluten, which may pose risks for individuals with dietary sensitivities.

These values indicate a deliberate focus on protein-rich meals, which may appeal to individuals seeking muscle maintenance or weight management. The nutritional profile of these dishes is aligned with health-conscious dietary trends, particularly in fitness and wellness communities.

Trứng Đúc Thịt Rán contains duck eggs, which are a common allergen, and is thus not safe for egg-allergic individuals. In contrast, Thịt Lợn Ba Chỉ Rang Cháy Cạnh has no allergens listed, making it a safer option for those with food sensitivities.

This inconsistency undermines the reliability of the nutritional data and may mislead health-conscious consumers. In contrast, other claims such as high protein, low fat, and heart-healthy profiles are well-supported by ingredient composition and preparation methods.

It is also free of dairy and gluten, which enhances its appeal to individuals with dietary restrictions. However, its inclusion of shrimp introduces a significant allergen risk. Despite this, the dish is described as heart-healthy due to its low saturated fat and lean protein content.
