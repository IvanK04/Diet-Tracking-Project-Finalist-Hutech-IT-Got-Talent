It is traditionally prepared by stir-frying rice noodles with eggs, tofu, bean sprouts, and a tamarind-based sauce, emphasizing a balance of umami, acidity, and heat. The dish is not only a staple in Thai households and street food stalls but also a global symbol of Thai cuisine. Its enduring popularity stems from its rich flavor profile and satisfying texture, achieved through high-heat stir-frying that develops depth and complexity. The dish's cultural significance is further reinforced by its presence in both domestic and international food settings, where it is often served as a main course.

It is a significant source of calcium and vitamin D, and its fat content contributes to a creamy texture and enhanced flavor in various culinary applications. As a basic form of cow's milk, it retains natural lactose and provides essential nutrients in their original proportions. This makes it a foundational ingredient in many food preparations, particularly in regions where dairy is a dietary staple.
