Roasted peanuts are identified as a nutritious, plant-based food with significant protein and healthy fat content, and are used to enhance both flavor and nutritional value in several traditional dishes. However, the presence of peanuts in these dishes introduces a known allergen risk, as peanuts are recognized as a major allergen in food. The community's structure links roasted peanuts to the dish *Nộm rau muống* through a direct ingredient relationship, and also connects peanuts to a broader allergen classification. This creates a dual nature—nutritional value and health risk—making the community relevant in both culinary and public health contexts.\",\n    \"rating\": 6.5,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderate to high due to the significant health risk posed by peanut allergies in food preparation and consumption, particularly in traditional dishes where peanuts are a core ingredient.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Roasted peanuts are a key nutritional and culinary ingredient in traditional Vietnamese cuisine\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Roasted peanuts are a central component in traditional Vietnamese dishes such as *Nộm rau muống*, where they contribute both flavor and nutritional value. The data confirms that each 28-gram serving contains 7 grams of protein, 14 grams of fat, and essential vitamins like vitamin A and C, as well as minerals including iron and calcium. These nutrients support dietary balance and make roasted peanuts a valuable ingredient in both snack and meal contexts. Their use in dishes like *Nộm hoa chuối thịt gà* and *Gỏi ngó sen* further underscores their versatility and cultural significance. This nutritional profile positions roasted peanuts as a health-conscious, plant-based food option, especially for vegetarians and vegans.

This protein content is higher than the general nutritional profile of roasted peanuts, indicating that the dish-specific preparation may enhance nutritional delivery. The peanuts also provide essential minerals such as potassium and calcium, which support overall health. The integration of roasted peanuts into this dish not only improves its sensory appeal but also strengthens its nutritional profile, making it a balanced and functional meal. This ingredient-dish relationship is a core part of the community's structure and reflects the deep cultural integration of peanuts in Vietnamese food traditions.

This allergen status is a critical public health concern, as allergic reactions can range from mild to life-threatening, including anaphylaxis. The relationship between peanuts and the allergen category is directly stated in the data, highlighting the potential for serious adverse outcomes in food service or home preparation environments.

In environments where individuals with peanut allergies are present—such as schools, restaurants, or family gatherings—the inclusion of roasted peanuts in dishes like *Nộm rau muống* can lead to unintended health consequences. This creates a tension between culinary tradition and food safety, requiring careful labeling, ingredient disclosure, and awareness. The data does not specify the prevalence of peanut allergies, but the fact that peanuts are classified as a known allergen implies that their use must be managed with caution.

This duality makes the community relevant across multiple domains, including nutrition, food safety, and cultural preservation. On one hand, the food is valued for its protein, fiber, and essential micronutrients, supporting healthy diets. On the other hand, the allergen risk introduces a barrier to safe consumption, especially in shared or unregulated food environments. This balance underscores the need for informed decision-making in food preparation and labeling.

This implies that food service providers and cultural institutions must implement allergen management practices, including ingredient transparency and staff training. The data does not provide specific case studies or incidents, but the classification of peanuts as an allergen is sufficient to justify the need for such measures.
