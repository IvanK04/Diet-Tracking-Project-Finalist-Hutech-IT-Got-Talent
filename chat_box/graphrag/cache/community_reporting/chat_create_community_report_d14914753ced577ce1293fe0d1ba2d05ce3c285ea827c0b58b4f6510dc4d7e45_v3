It is widely used in various dishes, indicating its commonality and culinary importance. The high degree of connectivity (3) suggests that it is a well-defined and frequently referenced product within the dataset. This foundational role positions mayonnaise as the core of the community's structure.

This relationship is explicitly stated in the dataset, where mayonnaise is described as being made using egg yolk as a key ingredient. The combined degree of 11 indicates a strong and well-established connection between the two entities, suggesting that this ingredient is not just a component but a foundational element in the formulation. This relationship is central to understanding the chemical stability and texture of mayonnaise.

This relationship is directly supported by the dataset, which states that mayonnaise requires an acidic ingredient to maintain its structure. The acidic component, though not named in detail, plays a crucial role in preventing separation of oil and water, which is essential for the condiment's consistency. The relationship has a combined degree of 4, indicating moderate but significant importance in the formulation process. This highlights the interdependence between the acidic ingredient and the overall functionality of mayonnaise.

This technical clarity suggests that the community is grounded in food science and culinary chemistry rather than social or political dynamics. The absence of any claims, legal issues, or reputational concerns further supports the idea that this is a purely technical and factual community.
