It is found in a wide range of foods including black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, catfish fillet, chicken livers, pork sausages, vinegar, sunflower seeds, salmon, pears, mangosteen, plantain, eggplant, and sticky rice. While some sources note its presence in oils like coconut oil, this is likely a translation error, as phosphorus is not a primary component of oils.
