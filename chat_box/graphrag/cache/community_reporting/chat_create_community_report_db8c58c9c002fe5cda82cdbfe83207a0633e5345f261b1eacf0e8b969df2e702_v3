Individuals with peanut or seafood allergies may be at risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, if exposed to these dishes without proper labeling or awareness. The fact that both peanuts and seafood are allergens in multiple dishes increases the complexity of food safety management. This risk is particularly acute in settings where food is prepared and served without strict allergen controls. Therefore, food service providers and community organizers must implement clear allergen labeling and awareness protocols to prevent harm.
