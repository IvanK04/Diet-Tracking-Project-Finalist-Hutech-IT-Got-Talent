The dish is categorized as a weight-maintenance meal due to its moderate energy and protein content, though it lacks sufficient dietary fiber. It is also noted for being high in sodium, which may make it unsuitable for individuals managing diabetes or cardiovascular conditions.

In Miến lươn trộn, it is linked to carrot, which provides texture and color, while in Cháo đỗ xanh and Cháo lươn cay, it is associated with white sugar as a flavor enhancer. This contradiction suggests a data inconsistency in the culinary database, possibly due to poor categorization or missing metadata. The dual usage implies that FOOD_029 is not a single ingredient but a system-level code that maps to different components depending on the dish context. This ambiguity undermines data reliability and may lead to misinformed recipe or nutritional recommendations.

These include peanuts (from roasted peanuts), fish (from eel), and garlic (from crushed garlic). The presence of eel introduces a fish allergen, which is particularly concerning for individuals with fish allergies. Roasted peanuts are explicitly listed as an allergen, and their inclusion in the dish makes it unsuitable for those with nut allergies. Garlic, while not typically a primary allergen, can trigger reactions in sensitive individuals. The data does not support a shellfish allergen, as eel is not explicitly described as shellfish. However, the allergen profile is significant and must be clearly communicated to consumers. This information is critical for food safety and labeling compliance.
