This broad involvement positions it as a foundational nutrient in human physiology. Specifically, Vitamin B1 contributes to energy metabolism through its role in enzymatic reactions that convert food into usable energy. It also supports the nervous system by maintaining neural health and cognitive performance, and aids in blood formation by contributing to red blood cell production. These functions are supported by direct relationships in the dataset [Data: Relationships (624, 625, 623)].

It is directly linked to energy metabolism through its participation in metabolic pathways that convert food into usable energy. Additionally, it supports nervous system health by maintaining neural integrity and cognitive function. It also plays a critical role in blood formation by aiding in the production of red blood cells, which ensures adequate oxygen transport throughout the body. This is supported by the relationship between Vitamin B3 and energy metabolism (ID 629), as well as its broader biological functions described in the entity description [Data: Entities (456), Relationships (629)]. The presence of niacin in sticky rice makes it a dietary staple in certain populations, enhancing its accessibility and reinforcing its role in public health.

The relationships show that each vitamin contributes to energy metabolism through different biochemical pathways, such as the production of coenzyme A (in the case of B5) or through activation of metabolic enzymes (in the case of B1 and B2). This collective involvement suggests a highly coordinated system for energy production.
