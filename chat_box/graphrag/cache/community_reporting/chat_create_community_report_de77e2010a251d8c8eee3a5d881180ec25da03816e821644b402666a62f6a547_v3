This process involves the natural activity of microorganisms that break down sugars in cabbage, producing lactic acid and contributing to the preservation and flavor profile.

This classification is supported by the direct relationship between Dưa Cải Muối and the 'THỰC_PHẨM_LÊN_MEN' entity, which denotes fermented food. Probiotics in fermented foods may promote digestive health and immune function, making this dish a subject of interest in nutritional science.
