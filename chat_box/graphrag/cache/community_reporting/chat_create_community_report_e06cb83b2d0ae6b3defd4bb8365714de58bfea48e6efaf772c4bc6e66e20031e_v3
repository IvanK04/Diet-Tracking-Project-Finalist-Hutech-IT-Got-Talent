The degree of the egg noodles entity (17) is relatively high compared to the health tags (degree 1), indicating that egg noodles are a central node in the food product network. However, the health tags themselves have minimal connections, suggesting that the community is narrow and focused on specific nutritional facts rather than broader social or operational dynamics.
