Key entities include Roasting, Brewing Process, Coffee Beans, Roasted Coffee, and Brewing Method. Roasting is a prerequisite step that transforms green coffee beans into roasted coffee, which is then used in brewing methods such as drip, French press, or espresso. The relationships show a clear sequence: green beans undergo roasting to become roasted coffee, which is then used in the brewing process, which in turn relies on a specific brewing method to extract flavor. This structured flow highlights the technical and industrial dependencies within coffee production, with roasting playing a foundational role in determining the final taste, aroma, and quality of brewed coffee.\",\n    \"rating\": 2.0,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is low as the community represents a standard industrial food production process with no indications of legal, safety, or reputational risks or public health concerns.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Roasting is a foundational and prerequisite step in coffee production\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Roasting is a critical and mandatory step in the transformation of green coffee beans into a consumable form. It is explicitly described as a prerequisite to the brewing process, with the relationship indicating that 'Roasting is a prerequisite step in the brewing process, as roasted coffee is used as the base material for brewing' [Data: Relationships (1633)]. Similarly, coffee beans undergo roasting to become roasted coffee, establishing a direct transformation pathway [Data: Relationships (1636)]. This sequence underscores that without roasting, the brewing process cannot proceed. The roasting process involves precise thermal treatment that triggers chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction and caramelization, which develop flavor, aroma, and color characteristics essential to coffee profiles [Data: Entities (671)]. These reactions are not merely cosmetic but fundamentally alter the sensory and chemical composition of the beans, making roasting a pivotal stage in coffee quality control. The dependency of brewing on roasted coffee means that any variation in roasting—such as temperature, duration, or consistency—can directly affect the final taste and quality of the brewed beverage. This makes roasting a key technical and quality control point in the supply chain.\",\n            \"data_references\": [\n                \"Relationships (1633)\",\n                \"Relationships (1636)\",\n                \"Entities (671)\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Coffee beans are transformed into roasted coffee through roasting\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The transformation of coffee beans into roasted coffee is a well-defined and essential process in coffee production. This transformation is explicitly documented in the data, where it is stated that 'Coffee beans undergo roasting to become roasted coffee' [Data: Relationships (1636)]. This process is not merely a physical change but a chemical one, involving heat-driven reactions that develop complex flavor compounds, aromatic profiles, and color. The roasting process determines the final characteristics of the coffee, such as its acidity, body, and roast level—ranging from light and bright to dark and bold [Data: Entities (671)]. The resulting roasted coffee is then used as the primary ingredient in the brewing process, making it a central link between raw materials and final products. This transformation is a key point of quality assurance, as inconsistencies in roasting can lead to variability in taste and consumer satisfaction. The data confirms that roasting is not optional but a necessary step in the production chain, and its success directly influences the downstream brewing outcomes.\",\n            \"data_references\": [\n                \"Relationships (1636)\",\n                \"Entities (671)\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Roasted coffee is the primary input for brewing processes\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Roasted coffee serves as the foundational ingredient in the brewing process, acting as the base material from which all coffee beverages are derived. This is clearly established in the relationship: 'Roasted coffee is the primary ingredient used in the brewing process to produce a final coffee beverage' [Data: Relationships (1635)]. The brewing process, which includes methods like drip, French press, or espresso, relies entirely on roasted coffee to extract flavor, aroma, and body. Without roasted coffee, no coffee beverage can be produced. This dependency highlights the centrality of roasting in the entire coffee value chain. The brewing process is not a standalone activity but a method applied to a pre-processed product—roasted coffee—thereby emphasizing the importance of upstream quality control. The data also notes that the brewing process is carried out using a specific brewing method, which further refines the flavor outcome [Data: Relationships (1634)]. Thus, the quality of the roasted coffee directly influences the final product, making roasting a critical point of intervention in product consistency and consumer experience.\",\n            \"data_references\": [\n                \"Relationships (1635)\",\n                \"Relationships (1634)\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Brewing method determines the final flavor and strength of coffee\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The choice of brewing method—such as drip, French press, or espresso—directly influences the taste, strength, and texture of the final coffee beverage. The data specifies that 'The brewing process is carried out using a specific brewing method to extract coffee flavor' and that 'A brewing method is a specific way of carrying out the brewing process to achieve different flavor outcomes' [Data: Relationships (1634)]. This indicates that brewing is not a uniform process but one that is highly method-dependent. Different methods involve varying extraction times, water temperatures, and pressure levels, which in turn affect the solubility of compounds like caffeine, acids, and oils. For example, espresso produces a concentrated, rich shot with a crema, while drip brewing yields a lighter, more balanced cup. This variability means that the brewing method is a key variable in consumer experience and product differentiation. While the brewing method does not alter the raw material (roasted coffee), it shapes how that material is expressed, making it a crucial element in product development and marketing.\",\n            \"data_references\": [\n                \"Relationships (1634)\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The community is technically grounded in food science and industrial processes\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The entire community is rooted in established food science and industrial food processing principles.
