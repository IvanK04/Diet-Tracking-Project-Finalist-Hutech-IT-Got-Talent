Pickled ginger is linked to digestive support and traditional meal pairings. Although chicken thighs are described as a protein-rich meat product, they are included in the network due to their functional pairing with pickled ginger in traditional meals and their nutritional value. The relationships emphasize shared health benefits and dietary roles, particularly in plant-based and balanced nutrition.
