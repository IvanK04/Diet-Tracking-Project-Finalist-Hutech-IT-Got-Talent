The entities are linked through shared biological functions and food sources, such as the presence of Vitamin C in Water Spinach and other plant-based foods, and the antioxidant properties of various nutrients. The relationships highlight how these nutrients contribute to health outcomes like immune function, antioxidant defense, and digestive wellness.

It is widely distributed across plant-based foods such as clementines, bell peppers, water spinach, lotus root, Dao fruits, and plantain. Scientific evidence supports its presence in these foods, with bell peppers and water spinach being particularly rich sources. The nutrient's role in enhancing iron absorption and combating oxidative stress underscores its importance in overall health. This broad dietary availability makes Vitamin C a key component of balanced nutrition.

It is explicitly noted as a source of Vitamin C, contributing to antioxidant defense and immune support. Additionally, it is rich in Vitamin A, which supports vision and immune function. These dual nutrient contributions position water spinach as a nutritionally significant food. The presence of water spinach in multiple relationships suggests its role as a cross-functional dietary component.

This co-occurrence suggests a potential synergistic effect in nutrient metabolism, where Vitamin C may enhance the absorption or utilization of Vitamin K, which is essential for blood clotting and bone health. While the exact biochemical interaction is not detailed, the co-location in food sources implies a functional relationship in dietary planning. This relationship adds depth to the nutritional network and may inform dietary recommendations.

These vitamins act as antioxidants, helping to reduce oxidative stress in the body. While this connection is less directly tied to the core Vitamin C and Water Spinach network, it expands the community's scope to include animal-based protein sources with antioxidant benefits.
