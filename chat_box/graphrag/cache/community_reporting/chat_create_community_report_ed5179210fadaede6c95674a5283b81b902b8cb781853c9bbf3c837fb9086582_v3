In the context of this dessert, it helps meld the various fruits and fats into a cohesive, appealing product. Its dual use in savory dishes like Bánh mì chảo demonstrates its adaptability, but in this community, its role is strictly culinary and sensory.

These elements work together to create a dynamic interplay of sweet, tart, and tangy notes, which is essential to the dessert’s appeal. The use of multiple fruits suggests a deliberate effort to balance acidity and sweetness, a common principle in traditional Vietnamese confectionery. This diversity in flavor components reflects a sophisticated understanding of taste harmony.

Butter is explicitly noted as a flavor and richness contributor, and its presence aligns with traditional methods of enhancing fruit-based desserts. Caramel, while not a standalone ingredient, functions as a coating that enhances the sensory experience.
