This supports the idea that shrimp is a subset of seafood, which is itself an allergen. This classification helps contextualize the allergen risk within broader food categories. It also implies that any seafood-containing dish may pose a risk to individuals with seafood allergies, not just shrimp-specific dishes.

While the relationships show exposure to shrimp, there is no evidence of TOM's medical history, personal health conditions, or prior allergic reactions. This absence of medical context limits the ability to assess the actual risk level. Without knowing TOM's allergy status, it is impossible to determine whether the exposure poses a real threat.
