It is described as essential for vision, immune function, and skin health, with its presence confirmed across diverse dietary sources. This centrality reflects its foundational role in human nutrition and public health. The entity's high degree (16) indicates strong interconnections, reinforcing its importance in the network. The consistent references to vitamin A's functions across multiple sources support its status as a core component of the community's informational structure.

This relationship is supported by a high-weighted connection (67) between kale and vitamin A, indicating a strong and well-documented nutritional link. The presence of kale in the community underscores the importance of leafy greens in a balanced diet and highlights the role of plant-based foods in providing essential micronutrients. This connection also aligns with broader nutritional guidelines that promote kale and similar vegetables for their health benefits.

This relationship is explicitly stated in the data and is supported by a moderate connection strength (19). Corn's inclusion in the community reflects its role as a widely consumed, gluten-free food that provides complex carbohydrates, fiber, and essential vitamins. The fact that corn contains vitamin A, even in smaller amounts, makes it a relevant source for populations seeking plant-based or accessible nutrition. This connection also highlights the nutritional diversity of staple crops.

It is directly linked to vitamin A and the immune system, with a clear statement that it supports immune function and blood health. This makes gan gà a notable entity in the community due to its concentrated nutrient profile. The relationship between gan gà and vitamin A (ID 2406) and between gan gà and the immune system (ID 2407) emphasizes its potential value in dietary planning for immune support. However, the context of gan gà as a traditional or regional food may limit its accessibility, which could affect its broader public health impact.

These functions are explicitly linked to both plant and animal-based sources, such as kale, corn, and gan gà. The immune system is described as being supported by vitamin A and iron from gan gà, reinforcing the nutrient's importance in disease prevention and overall health. Vision is also highlighted as a primary function, which is particularly relevant in populations with limited access to nutritious food. This dual role makes vitamin A a key focus in public health messaging and nutritional education.

This diversity reflects the adaptability of dietary patterns and the availability of vitamin A across different cultural and economic contexts. The presence of both common staples like corn and more specialized foods like gan gà suggests that vitamin A can be accessed through varied dietary choices. This diversity supports public health strategies that promote balanced diets and reduce nutritional deficiencies.

This information, while not directly tied to specific food sources, adds a layer of practical dietary guidance within the community. It implies that the effectiveness of vitamin A intake depends on meal composition, suggesting that nutritional recommendations should consider fat content in meals.
