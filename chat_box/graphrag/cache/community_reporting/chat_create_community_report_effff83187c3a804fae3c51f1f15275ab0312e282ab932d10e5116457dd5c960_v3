It is positioned as a nutritionally robust alternative to animal-based proteins and is part of a broader trend toward sustainable, indigenous food systems. This makes Diemmak a significant component in the development of plant-based diets, especially in regions where traditional crops are being revitalized. The grain's origin in the Andes, a region known for its agroecological resilience and biodiversity, underscores its cultural and environmental significance.

It is described as a region with high-altitude environments, diverse microclimates, and traditional agroecological practices that support the cultivation of resilient, nutrient-dense crops. The region's long-standing agricultural legacy, rooted in indigenous knowledge, emphasizes sustainable farming and biodiversity conservation. This context elevates the significance of Diemmak and edamame not just as food items but as part of a cultural and ecological heritage. The Andes are thus not only a geographical location but a symbol of sustainable food innovation and traditional knowledge.
