Its unique texture and ability to become pliable when soaked in water make it ideal for rolling and forming food items, providing a delicate, crisp outer layer that complements the filling. This functional property is central to its use in both home and professional kitchens across Southeast Asia, including in Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese culinary traditions. The material's natural origin and biodegradability also position it as an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic food wrappers.

When cooked, its starch converts into natural sugar, producing a sweet, tender texture that is suitable for grilling or use in soups. This makes it a valuable ingredient in plant-based diets where natural sweetness and nutritional value are prioritized. It is distinct from other root vegetables in its flavor profile, often described as a blend of carrot and cabbage, and is rich in vitamins and dietary fiber, supporting digestive health and making it a suitable choice for vegetarians. Its use in traditional and modern plant-based meals underscores its role in promoting balanced, wholesome eating.

While not directly linked to rice paper or cane sugar root in the provided data, kohlrabi shares a common domain with these ingredients—plant-based, nutrient-dense foods used in healthy eating. The relationship between kohlrabi and cane sugar root is noted in the data as a shared value in plant-based diets, though they belong to different plant families.
