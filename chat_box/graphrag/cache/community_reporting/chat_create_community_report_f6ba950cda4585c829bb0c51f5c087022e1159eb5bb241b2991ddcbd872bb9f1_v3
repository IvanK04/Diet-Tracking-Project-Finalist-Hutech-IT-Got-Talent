This dish contains red meat allergens, which may be a concern for individuals with specific dietary restrictions.

The high protein content is relevant for individuals requiring increased protein intake, such as athletes or those recovering from illness. The presence of this trait across different dishes suggests a broader trend in Vietnamese cuisine toward protein-rich meals. This is supported by the relationships linking these dishes to the HIGH_PROTEIN category.

The high-carb classification is relevant for individuals with high energy demands, such as athletes or those with active lifestyles. However, it also raises considerations for individuals managing blood sugar levels or following low-glycemic diets. The consistency of this attribute across diverse dishes—ranging from noodle bowls to fruit-based beverages—demonstrates a structural pattern in Vietnamese cuisine.
