Key entities include lemon (rich in vitamin C and flavonoids), cinnamon (a source of vitamin C, pantothenic acid, and antioxidants), and biotin and niacin (B-vitamins essential for metabolism, immune function, and blood sugar regulation). These entities are interconnected through shared food sources and health benefits, forming a cohesive nutritional ecosystem.
