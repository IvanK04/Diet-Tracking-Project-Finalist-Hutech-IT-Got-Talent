It has a translucent, juicy flesh with a mild sweet flavor and floral notes, less sour than rambutan. The thin, crisp skin is easy to peel to reveal black, shiny seeds inside. Fresh mango provides moderate amounts of vitamin C and potassium, with natural sugars contributing to its carbohydrate content compared to other fresh fruits.
