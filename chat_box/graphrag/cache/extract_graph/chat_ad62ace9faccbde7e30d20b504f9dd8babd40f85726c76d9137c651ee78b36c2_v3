It is well known for its high soluble fiber content—particularly beta-glucan—which supports heart health, and provides sustained energy through complex carbohydrates. Although naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination risk requires testing for individuals with gluten sensitivity, and its neutral flavor allows flexible use in both sweet and savory dishes when cooked with liquid.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG GRAIN WHITE RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Long grain white rice is a milled grain characterized by slender, long grains that separate and become fluffy when cooked. The polishing process removes the bran and germ, resulting in lower fiber content compared to brown rice. It is a good source of energy and contains vitamins such as thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and choline, as well as minerals including iron, zinc, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, and selenium.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large eggs are a type of poultry product, weighing 50 grams, with 143 calories, 12.6 grams of protein, and minimal carbohydrates (0.72 grams).
