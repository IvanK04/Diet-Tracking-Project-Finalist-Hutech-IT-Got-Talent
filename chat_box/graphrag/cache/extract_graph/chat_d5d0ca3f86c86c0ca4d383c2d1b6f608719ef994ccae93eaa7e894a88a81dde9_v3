The white flesh provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of saturated fat metabolized differently than long-chain fats, while the natural, sterile coconut water contains electrolytes such as potassium. Fresh coconut requires splitting the hard shell to access the sweet, edible flesh, which can be eaten raw, mashed, or used to extract coconut juice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANGO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mango is a tropical fruit known for its sweet, juicy flesh and moderate carbohydrate content.
