It is widely used in beverages, sauces, and cooked dishes for flavor enhancement. Chanh provides concentrated vitamin C and antioxidant flavonoids, and both its juice and peel are utilized in food preparation. Despite its sourness, it has an alkalizing effect during metabolism, making it beneficial in pH-balanced diets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVOCADO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avocado is a fruit known for its high content of healthy monounsaturated fats, providing essential nutrients such as vitamins K, E, and B6, and dietary fiber.
