It has a sweet, distinctive flavor with a soft, smooth texture that sets it apart from other tropical fruits. The enzyme papain found in unripe papaya helps with protein digestion. Fresh papaya is rich in vitamin C and folate and is commonly eaten raw, either directly from the rind or added to salads and smoothies. Its enzymes provide special benefits for digestive health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMBUTAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rambutan is a tropical fruit originating from Southeast Asia, characterized by its bright red outer skin covered with soft, hair-like spines (from the Malay word \"rambut\" meaning \"hair\").
