It is rich in protein but also contains significant amounts of saturated fat and sodium due to its preparation method. As an uncooked sausage, it must be thoroughly cooked (grilled, pan-fried, or baked) to ensure food safety. The flavor of raw sausage is diverse, ranging from light varieties for breakfast to strongly spiced types that vary by region.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOSE EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Goose egg is a large poultry egg with a thick, hard shell and a large, richly flavored yolk. It contains nearly double the protein and fat compared to chicken eggs, providing a smoother richness in grilled dishes but also having significantly higher cholesterol levels. Goose eggs are seasonal, typically available in spring; their hard shells require careful cracking, and they are especially suitable for dishes requiring rich, intense egg flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carrot is a root vegetable belonging to the family of root crops, commonly used in cooking and as a dietary supplement.
