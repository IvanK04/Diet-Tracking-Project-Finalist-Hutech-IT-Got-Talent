It is used in baking and is more nutritious than refined white flour due to its intact nutritional components. Whole wheat flour has a denser texture and slightly bitter taste, making it ideal for bread, pancakes, and cookies, though it requires more liquid in recipes due to its high water absorption capacity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole wheat flour is a type of wheat flour made by grinding the entire wheat kernel, preserving the bran and germ. It contains higher levels of dietary fiber, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and other essential minerals compared to refined flour. It is commonly used in health-conscious baking and is considered a more nutritious alternative to white flour.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White flour is a refined flour produced by removing the bran and germ from wheat, resulting in a finer texture and milder flavor. It has lower fiber and nutrient content than whole wheat flour and is commonly used in baking, though it lacks the vitamins and minerals found in whole grain versions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread is a baked food product typically made from flour, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Whole wheat flour is often used to make healthier varieties of bread, such as whole wheat bread, which retains more nutrients due to the inclusion of bran and germ.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANCAKES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pancakes are a type of flat, soft cake typically made with flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder. Whole wheat flour is suitable for making pancakes, offering a more nutritious option with higher fiber and B vitamins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cookie is a baked dessert made from flour, sugar, butter, and other ingredients. Whole wheat flour can be used in cookie recipes to increase nutritional value, though its denser texture may require adjustments in liquid content.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIETARY FIBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dietary fiber is a component of plant-based foods that aids digestion and helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Whole wheat flour contains higher levels of dietary fiber compared to refined flour, contributing to its health benefits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VITAMIN B GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vitamin B group includes several B vitamins such as B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B6, B12, folate, and biotin. Whole wheat flour is a good source of these vitamins, which are essential for energy metabolism, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Iron is a mineral essential for hemoglobin production and oxygen transport in the blood. Whole wheat flour contains iron, contributing to its nutritional value and helping prevent iron deficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAGNESIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Magnesium is a mineral involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including muscle and nerve function, energy production, and bone health. Whole wheat flour contains magnesium, which supports overall metabolic and physiological functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SODIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sodium is a mineral that helps regulate fluid balance and blood pressure. Whole wheat flour contains low levels of sodium, making it a healthier option for individuals managing blood pressure or sodium intake.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBOHYDRATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carbohydrates are a primary source of energy in the human diet. Whole wheat flour contains moderate levels of carbohydrates, which are broken down into glucose to fuel bodily functions. While it has a lower glycemic index than white flour, it still contributes to total carbohydrate intake.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fat is a macronutrient that provides energy and supports cell function. Whole wheat flour contains a small amount of fat, primarily from the germ, and is considered low in fat compared to other food products.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING<|>EVENT<|>Baking is a culinary process that involves heating food to develop texture and flavor. Whole wheat flour is used in various baking applications such as bread, pancakes, and cookies, where its nutritional profile enhances the final product.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD MAKING<|>EVENT<|>An event or process involving the preparation of bread using flour, water, yeast, and other ingredients. Whole wheat flour is commonly used in bread-making, especially in health-focused or traditional recipes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHEAT FLOUR<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>Wheat flour is the general term for flour made from wheat, while whole wheat flour specifically refers to flour that retains the bran and germ, making it more nutritious.
