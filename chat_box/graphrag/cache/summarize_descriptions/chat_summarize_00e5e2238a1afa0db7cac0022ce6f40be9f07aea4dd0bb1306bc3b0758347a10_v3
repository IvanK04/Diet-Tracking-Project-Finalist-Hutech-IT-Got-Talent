It is essential for amino acid metabolism, the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, and supports immune function. Vitamin B6 contributes significantly to nervous system health and overall metabolic regulation. This vitamin is found in a variety of foods, including mango and pineapple, where it supports metabolic and neurological well-being. Additionally, it is present in dill, further expanding its dietary sources. While the initial descriptions highlight its presence in fruits like mango and pineapple, the inclusion of dill as a source reinforces the diversity of plant-based foods that contain this nutrient. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all information aligns with Vitamin B6’s well-documented roles in metabolism, neurotransmitter production, and immune support. The consistent emphasis on its involvement in amino acid metabolism and nervous system health provides a unified and scientifically accurate picture. Vitamin B6 is not limited to a single food group but is distributed across different plant-based sources, making it accessible through a varied diet. Its presence in both tropical fruits and herbs like dill underscores its broad dietary availability. Despite the different food sources mentioned, the core functions of Vitamin B6 remain consistent across all references—supporting metabolic processes, maintaining proper nervous system function, and contributing to immune health. Therefore, the comprehensive role of Vitamin B6 extends beyond mere nutritional content, serving as a critical cofactor in biochemical pathways essential for human health. This summary integrates all available information to present a coherent, evidence-based account of Vitamin B6’s biological significance and dietary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
