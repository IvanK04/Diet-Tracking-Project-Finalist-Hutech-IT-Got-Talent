It is an excellent source of essential vitamins, including vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as folate and dietary fiber. With low calorie content, spinach supports weight management and is a popular choice in vegan diets, offering a nutrient-dense, plant-based option for a wide range of culinary applications. One of its notable characteristics is its high concentration of iron, which contributes to healthy blood function and energy levels. However, spinach naturally contains oxalic acid, which can bind to certain minerals like iron and calcium and reduce their absorption. Cooking spinach—such as by steaming, sautéing, or blending—effectively breaks down oxalic acid, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of these vital nutrients. This makes properly prepared spinach a particularly effective food for maximizing mineral intake. Despite its high vitamin content, the presence of oxalic acid means that raw consumption in large quantities may limit mineral absorption, so culinary preparation is recommended for optimal health benefits. Overall, SPINACH is a versatile, nutritious, and sustainable ingredient that supports both general wellness and specific dietary needs, including plant-based and weight-conscious eating patterns. Its combination of vitamins, minerals, and low caloric density makes it a valuable component in balanced diets. The vegetable's adaptability in various forms—raw in salads, cooked in soups or stir-fries, or blended into smoothies—further enhances its utility across different cuisines and dietary preferences. While some sources highlight a broader range of vitamins such as E, others emphasize A, C, and K, but the inclusion of E in the cabbage family context is consistent with botanical and nutritional data. Thus, the comprehensive profile of SPINACH reflects a well-rounded, health-promoting leafy green that, when prepared appropriately, delivers significant nutritional advantages. Its role in supporting immune function, bone health, and antioxidant activity further underscores its importance in a healthy diet. In summary, SPINACH is a nutrient-rich, low-calorie leafy green that is both accessible and beneficial when prepared through cooking to mitigate oxalic acid content and optimize mineral absorption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 442, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 677, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
