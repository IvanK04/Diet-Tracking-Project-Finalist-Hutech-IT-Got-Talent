This classification applies to both lunch and dinner, and in some contexts, may also extend to breakfast, though its primary usage is in the context of substantial, central meals. The category encompasses a variety of traditional dishes, such as miến lươn trộn and nộm bò kho, which are recognized for their role as foundational components of a meal. These dishes are considered essential in meal planning, as they provide the core nutritional and sensory experience of a dining occasion. MÓN CHÍNH is not limited to a single type of cuisine or preparation method, but rather functions as a broad classification that identifies dishes meant to be the centerpiece of a meal, distinguishing them from side dishes, appetizers, or desserts. The term emphasizes the dish's role in satisfying hunger and fulfilling the primary meal function, making it a key element in both household and restaurant meal structures. While some descriptions suggest that MÓN CHÍNH is exclusively for lunch or dinner, the inclusion of breakfast in one of the descriptions indicates a broader, more flexible application. However, given that the primary purpose of a main course is to serve as the central, substantial component of a meal, and considering that breakfast is typically a lighter meal, the most coherent interpretation is that MÓN CHÍNH is predominantly associated with lunch and dinner. The category thus serves as a functional and structural designation in Vietnamese culinary classification, helping to organize dishes by their role in the meal. Dishes labeled as MÓN CHÍNH are expected to be complete in themselves, offering a balanced combination of flavor, texture, and nutritional value. This classification supports both home cooks and restaurant staff in menu planning and customer service, ensuring that diners receive a clear understanding of what constitutes a primary meal. In summary, MÓN CHÍNH represents a fundamental category in Vietnamese cuisine, identifying dishes that serve as the main course—most commonly at lunch or dinner—offering a satisfying and complete meal experience. It includes traditional dishes like miến lươn trộn and nộm bò kho, which exemplify the variety and cultural significance of this category. While the inclusion of breakfast is noted, it is interpreted as an exception rather than a standard, due to the typical nature of breakfast as a lighter meal. Therefore, MÓN CHÍNH is best understood as a category for substantial, central meals, primarily served during lunch and dinner, and plays a vital role in the organization and experience of Vietnamese dining.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 522, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
