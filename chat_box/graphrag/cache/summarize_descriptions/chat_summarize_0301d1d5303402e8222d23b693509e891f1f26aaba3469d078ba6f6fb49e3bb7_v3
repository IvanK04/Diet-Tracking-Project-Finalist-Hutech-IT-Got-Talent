This characteristic is commonly found in a variety of vegetables and fruits, including green cabbage, celery, green peas, lemon, and kale. These foods are recognized for their low calorie density while still providing essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, which support overall wellness and metabolic health. The presence of the LOW_CALORIE tag underscores their suitability for integration into balanced diets and structured diet plans aimed at maintaining or losing weight. Green cabbage, for instance, is particularly noted for its low caloric profile and high nutritional value, contributing to satiety without adding significant energy intake. Similarly, lemon and kale offer not only low calories but also rich sources of antioxidants and vitamin C, enhancing their role in promoting long-term health. Celery and green peas also share this attribute, providing a satisfying texture and flavor while remaining low in calories, thus supporting dietary goals without compromising on taste or nutritional quality. The consistent association of LOW_CALORIE with these specific foods suggests a broader pattern in which plant-based, minimally processed foods are prioritized for their ability to support healthy weight management. This health tag is not merely a nutritional label but a functional indicator that aligns with modern dietary trends emphasizing sustainability, wellness, and metabolic balance. While the term \"LOW_CALORIE\" may be applied across different food items, its core significance remains consistent: it identifies foods that contribute to energy balance without excessive caloric intake. It is important to note that while these foods are low in calories, they are not devoid of nutritional value—rather, they offer a high nutrient-to-calorie ratio, which is critical for maintaining energy levels and supporting bodily functions. The use of the LOW_CALORIE tag in food descriptions, such as in the case of mang tai, suggests that even complex dishes can incorporate low-calorie components to meet health-conscious consumer demands. This indicates a growing trend in culinary practices where traditional recipes are adapted to include nutrient-dense, low-calorie ingredients. In summary, LOW_CALORIE is a key health attribute that highlights the suitability of specific foods—such as green cabbage, celery, green peas, lemon, and kale—for individuals seeking to manage their weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Its presence in diverse food contexts, from simple vegetables to prepared dishes like mang tai, reflects a broader shift toward mindful eating and nutritional transparency in food labeling.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 504, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 722, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
