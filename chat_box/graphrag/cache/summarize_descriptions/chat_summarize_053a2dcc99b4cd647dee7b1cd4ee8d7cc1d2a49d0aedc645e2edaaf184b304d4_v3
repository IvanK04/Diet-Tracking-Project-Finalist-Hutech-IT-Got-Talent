It serves as a widely used cooking medium in both traditional and modern cuisines, including Vietnamese dishes like Rau khoai lang xào tỏi and Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, where it is employed for sautéing and flavoring. In addition, it is commonly used in the preparation of cooked catfish and grilled Atlantic salmon, where it contributes to the development of flavor and texture, particularly through frying, which enhances the crispy consistency of the fish. Its neutral profile makes it ideal for frying, roasting, and sautéing, allowing it to blend seamlessly into a variety of recipes without overpowering the dish.  \n\nWhile vegetable oil is often used as a plant-based substitute for animal-based fats like butter, it is important to note that certain processing methods—particularly hydrogenation—can result in the formation of trans fats, which may have negative health implications. However, most commercially available vegetable oils are not hydrogenated and are typically rich in essential vitamins A and E, which offer health benefits such as supporting immune function and skin health. These nutrients contribute to the overall nutritional value of vegetable oil, making it a functional ingredient in both culinary and dietary contexts.  \n\nDespite its widespread use, the health profile of vegetable oil depends on the specific type and processing method. In Vietnamese cuisine, it is a staple cooking fat, providing energy during the cooking process and enhancing the sensory qualities of food. Its role extends beyond flavor and texture, as it supports energy transfer and heat stability during high-temperature cooking. Overall, vegetable oil remains a fundamental component in global cooking practices, valued for its functional properties, neutral taste, and nutritional content when sourced and processed appropriately.  \n\nIn summary, vegetable oil is a plant-derived cooking fat with a neutral flavor, widely used in frying, roasting, and sautéing across diverse cuisines, including Vietnamese, and is beneficial due to its vitamin content when processed without hydrogenation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 427, "prompt_tokens": 333, "total_tokens": 760, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
