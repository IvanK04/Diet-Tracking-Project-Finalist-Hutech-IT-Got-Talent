While specific formulations may vary by region, the use of perillen oil or related herbs is recognized as a common component in addressing respiratory discomfort associated with colds. These natural substances are believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that support the body’s response to cold-related ailments. Additionally, Kinh giới, a plant traditionally used in folk medicine, particularly in East Asian and Southeast Asian contexts, is noted for its efficacy in treating colds and respiratory symptoms. This herb is often incorporated into herbal blends or consumed as a tea to soothe congestion, reduce coughing, and support overall respiratory health. The integration of both perillen oil and Kinh giới highlights a broader pattern in traditional medicine where plant-based compounds are valued for their therapeutic effects on common illnesses. Though the exact mechanisms of action may not be fully scientifically validated, these remedies are deeply rooted in long-standing cultural practices and are widely trusted within local communities. The use of such remedies reflects a holistic approach to health, emphasizing natural, accessible, and culturally relevant solutions. Despite potential differences in preparation methods and regional variations, both perillen oil and Kinh giới share a common purpose: to provide symptomatic relief and support recovery from colds. It is important to note that while these remedies are traditionally effective and widely used, they should not replace medical advice for severe or persistent symptoms. Overall, COLD RELIEF represents a blend of empirical folk knowledge and botanical tradition, offering a natural, accessible, and culturally grounded approach to managing common cold symptoms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 329, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 510, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
