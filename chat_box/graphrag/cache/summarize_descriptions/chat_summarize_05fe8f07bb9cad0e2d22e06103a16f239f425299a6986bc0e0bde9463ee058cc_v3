It is involved in regulating blood coagulation, ensuring that wounds heal properly, and supporting the formation and maintenance of strong bones by facilitating calcium utilization in the skeletal system. Vitamin K is naturally present in a variety of plant-based and animal-derived foods, including kale, spinach, red cabbage, pickled mustard greens, kumquats, and coconut. While some sources note its presence in poultry gravy, this is likely due to the addition of vitamin K-rich ingredients during preparation rather than being a primary natural source. The vitamin is also found in mango, though in smaller quantities, and contributes to antioxidant activity and detoxification processes in the body. Its presence in leafy greens like kale and spinach underscores its importance in diets rich in vegetables. Vitamin K is particularly notable for its role in bone health, where it helps prevent bone loss and reduces the risk of fractures. Additionally, it supports metabolic functions related to calcium regulation, which is vital for both bone integrity and cardiovascular health. Although the specific sources of vitamin K vary, the consistent theme across all descriptions is its indispensable function in blood clotting and bone metabolism. Some descriptions highlight its antioxidant properties and detoxification benefits, suggesting broader physiological roles beyond clotting and bone health. Despite minor discrepancies in food sources—such as the mention of poultry gravy or coconut—these can be reconciled by recognizing that while these foods may contain trace amounts, the primary and most significant dietary sources are leafy greens like kale, spinach, and red cabbage. The emphasis on vitamin K’s role in blood clotting and bone health remains consistent and scientifically supported. Overall, Vitamin K is a vital nutrient that supports multiple physiological systems, with its most prominent functions being the prevention of excessive bleeding and the maintenance of strong, healthy bones. Its presence in a wide range of foods makes it accessible through a balanced diet, particularly one rich in fresh vegetables. The vitamin is essential for both adults and children, and deficiencies can lead to impaired clotting and weakened bones. Therefore, including vitamin K-rich foods in daily meals is recommended to support optimal health outcomes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 445, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 804, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
