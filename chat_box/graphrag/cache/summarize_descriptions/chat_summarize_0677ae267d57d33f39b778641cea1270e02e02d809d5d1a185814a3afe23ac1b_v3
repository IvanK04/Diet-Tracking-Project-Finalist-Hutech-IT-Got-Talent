It helps reduce oxidative stress in the body and supports overall wellness by enhancing immune response and protecting cells from damage. Found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, Vitamin C is particularly abundant in citrus fruits such as oranges and chanh, as well as in tropical fruits like kiwi, pineapple, papaya, rambutan, and mangosteen. It is also present in vegetables such as green cabbage (rau cải ngọt and rau cải ngồng xào tỏi), fresh pear, and leafy herbs like ngò rí and kinh giới. In addition to its immune-boosting properties, Vitamin C contributes to skin health and bone and joint support, with notable benefits in collagen production and antioxidant protection. It aids in iron absorption, further supporting overall metabolic and physiological function. While it is commonly associated with citrus fruits, its presence in diverse plant-based sources—including tamarind sauce and durian and thunh long—highlights its broad dietary availability. The nutrient is especially effective when consumed in its natural, raw form, maximizing its health benefits. Although some sources emphasize its presence in specific combinations like rau cải and herbs, the consistent theme across all descriptions is its multifaceted role in promoting immune resilience, cellular protection, and general well-being. Despite minor variations in food sources, there are no contradictory claims; all descriptions align in affirming Vitamin C’s importance in supporting health through antioxidant activity, immune function, and tissue repair. Thus, Vitamin C stands as a vital nutrient, widely distributed across the plant kingdom, offering significant health benefits when incorporated into a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 356, "prompt_tokens": 689, "total_tokens": 1045, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
