This dish is rich in essential nutrients, containing 462 calories, 50.8 grams of protein, 9.9 grams of carbohydrates, and 24.4 grams of fat. It is particularly valued for its high protein content, making it an excellent choice for individuals seeking to support muscle building and recovery. The dish also provides a notable amount of potassium, contributing to proper muscle and nerve function. Additionally, MỰC TRỨNG CHIÊN is a balanced dietary option, offering good levels of vitamin C, which supports immune function and collagen production.  \n\nDespite its nutritional benefits, MỰC TRỨNG CHIÊN contains seafood allergens, meaning it should be avoided by individuals with allergies to squid or other shellfish. This allergen consideration is critical for dietary planning and safety, especially in households or settings where food allergies are common. The dish is categorized under both a balanced diet and a maintenance diet, indicating its suitability for a range of dietary goals—ranging from general health maintenance to those focused on muscle development.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its role as a balanced meal with high vitamin C, others highlight its high fat and protein content, which aligns with its function as a maintenance and muscle-building food. These points are not contradictory but rather complementary, as the dish’s high protein supports muscle growth, while its nutrient profile—including vitamins and minerals—contributes to overall dietary balance. The presence of both protein and fat supports satiety and energy levels, making it a practical option for individuals managing their daily caloric intake.  \n\nIn summary, MỰC TRỨNG CHIÊN is a nutritious, protein-dense meal that combines the benefits of seafood and eggs to deliver essential nutrients. It is ideal for those aiming to build or maintain muscle mass, support daily energy needs, and maintain a balanced diet. However, due to its seafood content, it must be consumed with caution by individuals with shellfish allergies. Its versatility in dietary applications—suitable for both balanced and maintenance diets—makes it a valuable component in a well-rounded meal plan.  \n\nThe dish is not only a culinary option but also a functional food choice, offering a combination of macronutrients and micronutrients that support physical health. Its preparation as a fried dish may contribute to its higher fat content, but this is balanced by its high protein and vitamin C levels. Overall, MỰC TRỨNG CHIÊN stands out as a nutritious, allergen-aware, and muscle-supportive meal that fits well within both general wellness and fitness-focused dietary regimens.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 548, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 829, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
