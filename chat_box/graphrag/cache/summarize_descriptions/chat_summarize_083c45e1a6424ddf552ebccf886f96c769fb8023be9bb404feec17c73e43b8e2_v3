While it emphasizes reducing carbohydrates, it does not entirely eliminate them, as some sources indicate compatibility with plant-based foods such as coconut milk and chia seeds—both of which are low in carbohydrates and rich in healthy fats. This suggests that the KETO DIET can be adapted to include certain plant-based ingredients that align with its nutritional profile. Additionally, the diet is noted for its emphasis on high-fat and moderate-protein foods, with specific examples like da heo chiên giòn (fried pork) and cá tuyết chín (steamed snowfish) being identified as keto-friendly options. These foods, while culturally specific, reflect the inclusion of protein-rich and low-carbohydrate items that fit within the framework of the KETO DIET. However, the claim that the diet \"avoids carbohydrates\" is somewhat contradictory to the more accurate description of low rather than zero carbohydrate intake. Therefore, the most coherent and balanced interpretation is that the KETO DIET restricts carbohydrates to minimal levels, allowing for the inclusion of healthy fats and moderate protein, with select plant-based and animal-based foods that are low in carbs and high in fat. This flexibility enables individuals to follow the diet while incorporating culturally relevant and nutritionally sound food choices. The diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and metabolic improvements is supported by its focus on stable blood sugar levels and increased satiety through fat and protein. Overall, the KETO DIET remains a versatile and widely practiced approach to nutrition, combining scientific principles with practical, culturally adapted food selections.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 572, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
