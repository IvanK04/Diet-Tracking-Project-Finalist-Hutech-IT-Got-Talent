Found in a wide variety of plant-based foods, including mustard greens, mango, plums, peach, kabocha squash, and cantaloupe, Vitamin C plays a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress. Its antioxidant activity helps neutralize harmful free radicals, reducing cellular damage and promoting long-term health. In addition to its protective functions, Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a key structural protein in connective tissues, which supports skin integrity, joint health, and the strength of blood vessels. This nutrient also enhances the absorption of non-heme iron from plant-based diets, making it particularly beneficial for individuals following vegetarian or vegan lifestyles. Furthermore, Vitamin C contributes to wound healing by facilitating tissue repair and regeneration, ensuring the body can recover efficiently from injuries. Its presence in diverse fruits and vegetables underscores its widespread availability and importance in a balanced diet. While the specific sources of Vitamin C vary—such as leafy greens like mustard greens and tropical fruits like mango and peach—its core biological functions remain consistent across all these food sources. The nutrient's role in immune support is well-documented, helping to maintain a robust defense system against infections and illnesses. Although some descriptions emphasize its presence in specific foods, the underlying functions—antioxidant activity, immune support, collagen synthesis, and iron absorption—are unified and non-contradictory, reinforcing the consistent scientific understanding of Vitamin C. There are no conflicting claims in the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively highlight the versatility and importance of Vitamin C across different dietary sources. The information presented aligns with established nutritional science, confirming that Vitamin C is not only widely available but also indispensable for multiple physiological processes. Whether derived from cruciferous vegetables like mustard greens or from sweet fruits such as plums and cantaloupe, Vitamin C delivers consistent health benefits. Its presence in both fresh produce and seasonal crops ensures that individuals can access this essential nutrient through a variety of dietary choices. In summary, Vitamin C is a foundational nutrient that supports immune function, combats oxidative stress, promotes tissue repair, and enhances iron absorption, making it a critical component of a healthy, balanced diet. Its broad dietary sources and well-documented benefits underscore its significance in human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 481, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 730, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
