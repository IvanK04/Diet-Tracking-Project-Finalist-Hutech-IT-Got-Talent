It is naturally found in a variety of foods, including bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, and chicken livers. These dietary sources contribute to maintaining healthy cell growth and supporting proper neurological and physical development in fetuses. Folate is particularly important during periods of rapid cell division, such as in early pregnancy and infancy, where adequate intake helps prevent neural tube defects and supports overall developmental health. While the presence of folate in bơ tươi, black beans, and almonds is well established, its high concentration in chicken livers further underscores its significance as a nutrient-rich food source. The consistent emphasis across the descriptions on folate’s role in cell division and fetal development highlights its fundamental biological importance. Although the specific food sources vary slightly—such as the inclusion of bơ tươi and chicken livers—these differences do not contradict the core function of folate; rather, they illustrate its widespread availability in diverse dietary options. This broad dietary distribution ensures that individuals can obtain sufficient folate through various meals, promoting both general health and reproductive wellness. The nutrient’s role in DNA synthesis and cell division is universally recognized, reinforcing its status as a cornerstone of human nutrition, especially in prenatal care. In summary, Folate is a critical B-vitamin found in foods such as fresh coconut, black beans, almonds, and chicken livers, supporting essential biological processes like cell division and fetal development. Its presence across different food groups makes it accessible and vital for maintaining health throughout life, particularly during pregnancy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 537, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
