It is essential for brain development and function, supporting proper nervous system activity and cognitive health. Vitamin B6 is involved in energy metabolism, the synthesis of proteins, and the production of red blood cells, contributing to blood formation and overall hematological function. It also supports heart health and acts as a source of antioxidants, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage and aiding in iron metabolism.\n\nThe vitamin is found in a variety of dietary sources, including pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and black sesame seeds. These foods provide a natural and accessible means of obtaining Vitamin B6, which is particularly important for maintaining metabolic balance and supporting neurological and hematological health. While some sources emphasize its presence in pears and mangosteen, others highlight its occurrence in sticky rice and black sesame seeds, indicating a broad dietary range. This diversity in food sources underscores the vitamin’s widespread availability across different cuisines and diets.\n\nAlthough the descriptions vary slightly in the specific foods mentioned, there is no contradiction in the core functions of Vitamin B6. All descriptions converge on its critical roles in brain development, nervous system function, energy metabolism, and blood formation. The inclusion of both plant-based sources like pears, mangosteen, and sticky rice, as well as seeds such as black sesame, reflects its presence in diverse global diets. The Vietnamese description noting its role in protein metabolism and red blood cell production aligns with the broader scientific understanding of Vitamin B6’s biochemical functions.\n\nIn summary, Vitamin B6 is a multifunctional nutrient essential for neurological development, metabolic processes, and hematological health. It is naturally present in a range of foods, including pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and black sesame seeds, making it accessible across various dietary patterns. Its contributions to energy production, nervous system function, and red blood cell synthesis make it a key component of a balanced diet. As a source of antioxidants and iron support, Vitamin B6 further enhances cardiovascular and cellular health. Overall, Vitamin B6 remains a critical nutrient for maintaining optimal bodily function and well-being.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 447, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 723, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
