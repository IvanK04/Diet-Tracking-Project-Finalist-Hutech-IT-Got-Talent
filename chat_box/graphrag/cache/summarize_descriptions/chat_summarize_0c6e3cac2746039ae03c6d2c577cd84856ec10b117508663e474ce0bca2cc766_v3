It represents a refreshing, light, and balanced meal style that emphasizes the use of fresh, seasonal ingredients. SALAD typically features a combination of crisp vegetables like cucumber, tomato, and bean sprouts, which are valued for their mild flavors and textural contrast. Mint is often incorporated, adding aromatic depth and aligning with broader culinary traditions such as Middle Eastern cuisine, though in the Vietnamese context, it serves as a complementary herb rather than a primary component. The dish is commonly prepared raw, with ingredients dressed in oil and vinegar to enhance flavor and preserve freshness. It is frequently served as a starter or side dish, though it can also function as a main course, especially in health-conscious or low-calorie meal patterns. SALAD embodies a commitment to fresh, nutritious eating, highlighting the health benefits of raw, unprocessed ingredients. While it is sometimes categorized as a food event or culinary experience, its primary identity remains that of a dish composed of balanced, vibrant components. The inclusion of bean sprouts underscores the dish’s emphasis on crispness and mildness, contributing to its appeal as a light and refreshing option. Across various descriptions, the consistent theme is the freshness, simplicity, and health-oriented nature of SALAD. Contradictions—such as its classification as both a dish and an event—are resolved by recognizing that \"event\" may refer to a cultural or social context in which SALAD is served, rather than a core attribute of the dish itself. Ultimately, SALAD functions as a traditional Vietnamese culinary category that celebrates balance, freshness, and nutritional value, making it a staple in both everyday meals and health-focused dining.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 746, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
