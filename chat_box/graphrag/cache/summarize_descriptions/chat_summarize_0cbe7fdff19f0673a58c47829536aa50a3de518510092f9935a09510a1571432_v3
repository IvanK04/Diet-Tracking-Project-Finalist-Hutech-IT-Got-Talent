Found in a wide variety of foods, magnesium contributes to overall metabolic and physiological well-being. It is present in cháo gà (36.3mg per serving), Nộm bò khô (84.8mg per serving), black beans, almonds, catfish fillet, thunh long, durian, whole wheat flour, sticky rice, coconut water, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, salmon, chicken livers, pears, mangosteen, vinegar, pork sausages, and even in foods like oil and dried blood (dồi huyết). Its presence in these diverse dietary sources underscores its broad nutritional significance. Magnesium supports muscle and nerve function across multiple food groups, including those such as pineapple juice, chè thái, and dried beef salad. It is particularly vital in enzymatic processes related to energy metabolism and cellular function. In Vietnamese dietary context, magnesium is recognized as a key mineral in foods like coconut oil, black beans, and sunflower seeds, where it supports both nervous and muscular health. While some sources note higher concentrations in specific items like Nộm bò khô, magnesium is consistently present in various plant and animal-based foods, contributing to balanced nutrition. Despite minor variations in food sources and quantities, all descriptions converge on magnesium’s central role in maintaining physiological balance. The mineral’s involvement in over 300 biochemical reactions highlights its indispensable function in human health, making it a fundamental component of a nutritious diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 746, "total_tokens": 1092, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
