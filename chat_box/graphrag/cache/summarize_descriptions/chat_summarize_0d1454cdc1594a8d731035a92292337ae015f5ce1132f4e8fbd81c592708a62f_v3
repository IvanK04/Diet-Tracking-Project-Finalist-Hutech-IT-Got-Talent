It is specifically mentioned in multiple sources as a potential allergen and is highlighted as a common food trigger for allergic reactions. The allergenic properties of CÁ are especially notable in individuals sensitive to fish, with specific references to species such as cá thu (snapper) and cá tuyết (snowfish) as examples of fish types that may provoke allergic responses. These species are identified as types of CÁ that can cause adverse reactions in sensitive individuals, including symptoms such as skin rashes, respiratory issues, or anaphylaxis. While the term \"CÁ\" may refer broadly to various types of fish, the descriptions consistently emphasize its role as a significant allergen within the context of food allergies. The information is consistent across all provided sources, with no contradictory elements—each description reinforces the idea that CÁ is a recognized allergen, particularly in fish-allergic populations. The specificity to certain fish species like cá thu and cá tuyết adds nuance to the general classification, indicating that not all forms of CÁ may carry equal allergenic potential, but all are considered part of the broader allergenic category. Therefore, individuals with known fish allergies should exercise caution when consuming any form of CÁ, especially those derived from these specific species. The data collectively supports the conclusion that CÁ is a well-documented allergen in food allergy contexts, with clinical and dietary relevance. This information is critical for both healthcare providers and consumers to identify and manage potential allergic reactions. In summary, CÁ is a recognized food allergen, particularly in people with fish sensitivities, and specific fish types such as cá thu and cá tuyết are noted as common triggers. Awareness of this allergen is essential for preventing allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
