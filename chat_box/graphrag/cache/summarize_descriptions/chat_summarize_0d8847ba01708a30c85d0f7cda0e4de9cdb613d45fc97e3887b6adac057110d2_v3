It plays a critical role in maintaining healthy skin, bones, and blood vessels. Found naturally in a wide variety of foods, Vitamin C is present in bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, ngò tây (basil), coconut water, and bean sprouts. These dietary sources contribute to its high nutritional value and offer significant health benefits. As an antioxidant, Vitamin C helps neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases. Its involvement in collagen production is vital for skin elasticity, wound healing, and the integrity of connective tissues. While the vitamin is not stored in large amounts in the body due to its water-soluble nature, consistent intake through a balanced diet or supplements is necessary to maintain optimal levels. The presence of Vitamin C in diverse plant-based foods underscores its widespread availability and importance in daily nutrition. All provided descriptions converge on the core functions of Vitamin C—immune support, antioxidant activity, and collagen production—while highlighting its presence in specific foods such as black beans, almonds, basil, coconut water, and bean sprouts. Although some descriptions mention specific food sources with varying emphasis, there is no contradiction in the overall scientific consensus regarding Vitamin C’s biological roles. The consistent theme across all sources is that Vitamin C is a vital nutrient with broad health benefits, particularly in promoting immune health and tissue integrity. Therefore, Vitamin C stands as a foundational nutrient in human wellness, supported by both dietary intake and biological function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
