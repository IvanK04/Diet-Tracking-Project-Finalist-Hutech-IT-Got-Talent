While often referred to as a root vegetable due to its edible underground part, it is also sometimes classified as a leafy green, reflecting its dual use in both leaf and stem forms. This versatile ingredient is valued for its nutritional profile, offering a low-calorie, low-fat option that supports healthy eating and weight management. Per 110 grams of lotus root, it contains 17.2 grams of carbohydrates, along with essential vitamins and minerals including vitamin C, niacin, thiamin, folate, iron, zinc, iodine, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. These nutrients contribute to immune function, energy metabolism, and overall cellular health. \n\nThe vegetable is commonly prepared in a variety of traditional dishes, such as stir-fries, soups, and steamed preparations, where its firm texture and mild flavor make it a popular addition to both savory and light meals. Its high content of vitamin C and folate supports antioxidant activity and helps in the production of red blood cells, while its mineral composition aids in maintaining proper fluid balance, nerve function, and bone health. Despite its low fat content, lotus root provides a balanced source of macronutrients, making it suitable for individuals following a balanced or weight-conscious diet. \n\nAlthough some sources describe lotus root as a leafy green, the primary edible portion—its thick, fibrous root—aligns more closely with root vegetable classification, especially in culinary and nutritional contexts. This clarification resolves any potential contradiction between the leafy green and root vegetable designations, as both components are used in cooking, but the root is the most nutritionally significant and widely consumed part. The plant's structure, with its hollow stem and broad leaves, supports its use in both fresh and preserved forms, such as pickled or dried versions, further expanding its culinary applications. \n\nIn summary, lotus root is a nutritious, low-calorie, and versatile ingredient in Asian cuisine, valued for its rich mineral and vitamin content, particularly vitamin C, folate, and essential trace elements. It is a staple in traditional diets and is well-suited for those seeking healthy, sustainable food options. Whether used in stir-fries, soups, or as a side dish, lotus root offers a flavorful and health-promoting addition to meals, making it a key component in balanced and culturally significant food practices. Its combination of culinary utility and nutritional value underscores its importance in both everyday cooking and dietary wellness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 530, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 820, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
