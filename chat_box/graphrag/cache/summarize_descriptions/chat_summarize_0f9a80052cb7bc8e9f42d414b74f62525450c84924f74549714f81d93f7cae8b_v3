This process results in a finer texture and a milder, more neutral flavor compared to whole grain flours. As a result, white flour is widely used in baking as a foundational ingredient in a variety of baked goods, including bread, cakes, pastries, and cookies. Its refined nature means it contains significantly lower levels of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals—particularly B vitamins and essential minerals like iron and magnesium—compared to whole wheat flour, which retains the bran and germ and offers greater nutritional value. The reduced fiber content also affects its moisture absorption properties, making it more predictable in baking applications where consistent texture and structure are required. While white flour is favored for its smooth consistency and versatility in recipes, its lack of nutrients has led to growing interest in whole grain alternatives for health-conscious consumers. Despite these differences, white flour remains a staple in both home and commercial baking due to its availability, affordability, and reliable performance in a broad range of culinary applications. The primary distinction between white flour and whole grain flour lies in the degree of refinement: white flour is fully processed, whereas whole grain flour retains the natural components of the wheat kernel. This refinement contributes to its lighter color and more uniform texture, but also diminishes its nutritional profile. Overall, white flour plays a central role in modern baking, serving as a versatile and accessible base ingredient, though its nutritional limitations are increasingly recognized in dietary discussions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 308, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 574, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
