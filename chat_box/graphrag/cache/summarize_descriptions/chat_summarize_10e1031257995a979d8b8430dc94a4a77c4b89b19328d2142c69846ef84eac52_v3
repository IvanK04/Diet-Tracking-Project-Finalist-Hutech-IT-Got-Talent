It contains 14 grams of fat per 14 grams of product, with no protein or carbohydrates, making it a pure source of dietary fat. The oil is naturally gluten-free and free of dairy, rendering it suitable for individuals following vegetarian diets. It provides essential fatty acids, including omega-3 and omega-6, which are important for maintaining healthy cell function and overall well-being. However, the specific fatty acid profile varies depending on the plant source—such as sunflower, olive, or flaxseed—determining its nutritional benefits and culinary applications.\n\nWhile Cooking Oil contains no vitamins or minerals, it plays a vital role in energy provision and the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. The presence of allergens varies by type and may include sesame, soy, mung beans, and peanuts. These allergens are common in certain plant-based oils, such as soybean or sesame oil, and consumers with allergies to these ingredients should carefully check product labels. The allergen list is not exhaustive and may differ based on processing methods or regional sourcing, emphasizing the importance of ingredient transparency.\n\nDespite some descriptions noting a fat content of 14 grams per 14 grams (which simplifies to 1 gram of fat per gram of product), the consistent data across sources confirms that Cooking Oil is a concentrated source of fat, with a typical fat content of 14 grams per 14-gram serving. This ratio is functionally equivalent to 100% fat content in that portion, aligning with its primary role as a fat-based cooking medium. The absence of protein and carbohydrates underscores its function as a neutral, energy-dense ingredient in food preparation.\n\nCooking Oil is widely accessible and used across diverse cuisines, from Asian stir-fries to Western frying techniques. Its versatility stems from its ability to withstand high temperatures and its neutral flavor profile, which allows it to complement a wide range of dishes. However, the nutritional value and safety profile depend heavily on the specific type of oil. For instance, oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids—such as flaxseed or canola—offer additional health benefits compared to those high in omega-6, like corn or soybean oil. Consumers are encouraged to choose oils based on both dietary needs and allergen considerations.\n\nIn summary, Cooking Oil is a fundamental component of modern kitchens, serving as a fat-based cooking medium with no protein or carbohydrates. It is suitable for vegetarians and free of dairy and gluten, though it may contain allergens such as soy, sesame, mung beans, or peanuts depending on the source. While it lacks vitamins and minerals, it contributes essential fatty acids to the diet. Proper labeling and awareness of allergens are critical for safe consumption. Overall, Cooking Oil remains a versatile, widely used ingredient in both home and commercial cooking, with its nutritional and safety profile varying by type.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 614, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 897, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
