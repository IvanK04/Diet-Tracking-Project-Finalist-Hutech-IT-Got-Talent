It is a key component of DNA and RNA, contributing to genetic stability and cellular function. Phosphorus supports cellular energy production and is involved in various metabolic processes, including energy transfer and metabolism. Found in a wide range of foods, including black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, catfish fillet, chicken livers, pork sausages, vinegar, sunflower seeds, salmon, pears, mangosteen, plantain, eggplant, and sticky rice, phosphorus is widely distributed across both plant and animal-based diets. While some descriptions mention its presence in oils such as coconut oil, this is likely a translation or contextual error, as phosphorus is not a primary component of oils in the same way as fats; the role in cell structure and bone health remains consistent. All sources agree that phosphorus is essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth, facilitating energy production, and supporting fundamental cellular processes. Although some descriptions list specific food sources with slight variations, the core functions of phosphorus remain unified across all references. The mineral is particularly important in energy metabolism, where it enables the conversion and storage of energy in ATP, and in the formation of cellular structures. Its presence in diverse dietary sources ensures that adequate intake can be achieved through a balanced diet. Despite minor discrepancies in food sources or phrasing, there is no contradiction in the fundamental biological roles of phosphorus. Therefore, the comprehensive summary reflects a consistent and scientifically accurate portrayal of phosphorus as a critical mineral for human physiology.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 540, "total_tokens": 881, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
