It is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, supporting the body’s ability to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. Additionally, riboflavin is critical for the formation and maintenance of red blood cells, contributing to healthy hematopoiesis and preventing anemia.  \n\nThis vitamin is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including plant-based and animal-based foods. It is found in spinach and peanut butter, where it contributes to energy metabolism and red blood cell formation. In animal products, riboflavin is present in fish, pork belly, and shallots, further supporting cellular function and metabolic processes. It is also detectable in less conventional sources such as brown sugar and sunflower oil, indicating a broad dietary presence.  \n\nThe biological importance of riboflavin is underscored by its role as a precursor to two key coenzymes: flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These coenzymes participate in redox reactions essential for energy production, antioxidant defense, and the synthesis of other vital molecules. Without adequate riboflavin intake, individuals may experience symptoms such as fatigue, sensitivity to light, sore throat, and skin disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining overall physiological balance.  \n\nDespite variations in the specific food sources mentioned across the descriptions, there is no contradiction in the core facts: riboflavin is consistently identified as a B-vitamin involved in energy production and cellular function. The only variation lies in the list of food sources, which collectively demonstrate its widespread availability in both plant and animal-based diets. This diversity in dietary sources makes riboflavin accessible to a broad range of populations, supporting its role as a fundamental nutrient.  \n\nIn summary, riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a vital nutrient that supports energy metabolism, cellular function, and red blood cell formation. It is naturally present in a wide array of foods, including spinach, peanut butter, fish, pork belly, shallots, brown sugar, and sunflower oil. Its presence across diverse dietary sources ensures that individuals can meet their daily requirements through a balanced diet. As a foundational component of metabolic processes, riboflavin remains an essential nutrient for maintaining health and optimal bodily function.  \n\n(Word count: 498)", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 519, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
