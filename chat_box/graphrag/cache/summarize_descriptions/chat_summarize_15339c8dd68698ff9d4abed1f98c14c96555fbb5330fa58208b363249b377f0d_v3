It consists of uncooked, ivory-colored seeds that naturally possess a bitter saponin coating, which must be rinsed before cooking to remove any potential irritation. In its dry state, quinoa provides a complete plant-based protein, containing all nine essential amino acids, making it a valuable source of high-quality protein for vegetarians, vegans, and individuals with dietary restrictions. When cooked, the seeds expand threefold, developing a light, fluffy texture that mimics traditional grains, allowing them to serve as a nutritious substitute for rice, couscous, or other grain-based dishes.  \n\nQuinoa is exceptionally rich in dietary fiber and a broad spectrum of essential vitamins and minerals. Key nutrients include vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, copper, manganese, selenium, phosphorus, iodine, and molybdenum. These nutrients contribute to its heart-healthy properties and support various bodily functions, including energy metabolism, immune function, and bone health. Its low glycemic impact makes it a suitable choice for individuals managing blood sugar levels.  \n\nAlthough sometimes categorized under legumes or grains due to its culinary use, quinoa is botanically a seed and is not a true grain. It is naturally gluten-free, making it ideal for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Its plant-based origin and comprehensive nutrient content position quinoa as a highly nutritious and sustainable food option. With its balanced amino acid profile, high fiber content, and wide array of micronutrients, quinoa stands out as a versatile and health-promoting staple in modern diets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 536, "total_tokens": 917, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
