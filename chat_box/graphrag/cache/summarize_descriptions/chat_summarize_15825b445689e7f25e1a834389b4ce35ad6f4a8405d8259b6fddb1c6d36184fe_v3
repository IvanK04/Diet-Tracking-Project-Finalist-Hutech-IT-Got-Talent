It serves as a foundational element in numerous meals, commonly eaten as toast, in sandwiches, or as a base for other foods such as whole milk or oatmeal. Whole grain flour is particularly emphasized in bread-making, especially in whole grain bread, where it is noted to be effective in enhancing nutritional value and texture. While some variations of bread incorporate additional ingredients—such as bean sprouts—these are typically included in raw form to preserve their crunch and are most commonly found in sandwiches or toast. The inclusion of raw bean sprouts highlights a specific culinary application where texture and freshness are prioritized. Despite the diversity in preparation and ingredient use, the core composition of bread remains consistent: a mixture of flour, water, and yeast, baked to create a versatile and widely consumed food. Bread functions not only as a standalone item but also as a vehicle for other foods, supporting both dietary variety and nutritional balance. Its role in daily meals underscores its importance in global diets, from simple breakfasts to more complex meals. Although some descriptions suggest a focus on whole grain benefits, the presence of raw bean sprouts introduces a more specific, regional or cultural variation that does not contradict the general definition of bread. Rather, it reflects the adaptability of bread as a flexible food item that can be customized to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. Overall, BREAD remains a fundamental component of human nutrition and culinary practice, valued for its simplicity, versatility, and cultural significance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 617, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
