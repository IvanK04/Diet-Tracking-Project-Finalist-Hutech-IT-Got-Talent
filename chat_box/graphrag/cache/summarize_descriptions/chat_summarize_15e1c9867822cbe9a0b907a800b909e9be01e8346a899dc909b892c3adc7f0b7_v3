Classified under grains, it serves as a nutritious and versatile alternative to traditional flours, particularly for individuals following vegan, grain-free, or gluten-free diets. It is composed primarily of carbohydrates, providing 16.8 grams per 30 grams of serving, along with a range of essential vitamins and minerals. These include niacin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, riboflavin, and vitamin B6, as well as trace amounts of iron, zinc, iodine, sodium, calcium, and choline. The mild natural sweetness of corn flour makes it suitable for a variety of baking and cooking applications. As a gluten-free grain alternative, it is widely used in recipes requiring a neutral flavor and texture, such as in cakes, breads, and thickening agents. Its nutritional profile supports overall dietary balance, offering both energy and key micronutrients. While it is derived from whole corn kernels, the processing typically removes the bran and germ, resulting in a refined product that retains its core nutritional value. Corn flour is especially beneficial for those with dietary restrictions, including celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, and is a staple in many gluten-free and plant-based food formulations. Despite being a refined grain product, it maintains a natural composition and is recognized for its functional properties in food preparation. Overall, corn flour combines practicality with nutritional value, making it a widely adopted ingredient in modern and health-conscious cooking.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 309, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
