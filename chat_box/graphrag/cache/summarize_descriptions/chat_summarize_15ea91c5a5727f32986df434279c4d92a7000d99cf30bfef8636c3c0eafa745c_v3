It plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and well-being by supporting cellular growth, immune defense, and proper vision. Found in a wide range of dietary sources, VITAMIN_A is present in both animal and plant-based foods. Animal sources include liver, dairy products, fish, and scallops, while plant sources such as carrots, sweet potatoes, corn, ridge gourd, and citrus fruits—like bưởi chùm and ngò tây—also provide significant amounts of the vitamin. Although the initial description mentions whole chicken and citrus fruits, the more comprehensive and consistent information across the sources highlights a broader spectrum of dietary sources, including dairy, fish, and various vegetables. The presence of VITAMIN_A in both animal and plant products underscores its versatility and accessibility in different diets. While some descriptions note its role in cell growth, others emphasize immune and skin health, with all sources converging on the core functions of vision, immunity, and skin integrity. There is no contradiction in the descriptions; rather, they collectively reinforce the vitamin’s importance and diverse sources. The inclusion of specific foods such as bưởi chùm, ngò tây, and ridge gourd adds cultural and nutritional context, particularly relevant in regions where these ingredients are commonly consumed. Overall, VITAMIN_A is a vital nutrient that contributes to multiple physiological processes and is widely available across both animal and plant-based diets, making it a fundamental component of a balanced and healthy diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 687, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
