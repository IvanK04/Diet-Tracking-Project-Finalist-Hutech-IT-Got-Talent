It functions as a key electrolyte, playing a vital role in maintaining fluid balance, enabling nerve signaling, and facilitating muscle contraction. These physiological functions underscore its importance in sustaining normal cellular activity, blood pressure regulation, and overall homeostasis. Sodium is present in numerous foods, including natural sources such as squid, grouper, papaya, coconut, mango, cinnamon, lemon, kale, chicken wings, green cabbage, cucumber, tomato, brown sugar, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and milk caramel filled squares. While sodium is found in both plant-based and animal-based foods, its concentration varies significantly—higher levels are typically found in processed items and certain animal products like chicken wings and milk caramel filled squares, whereas natural sources such as cucumber and tomato contain it in low amounts but still contribute to overall electrolyte balance. It is also present in less commonly recognized sources like peanut oil, sunflower oil, and brown sugar. Although some descriptions note sodium's presence in foods like amaranth and fish fillets, the consistent emphasis across all sources is on its fundamental biological necessity. Despite minor discrepancies in specific food examples, there is no contradiction in the core scientific facts: sodium is essential for fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle activity. The variations in food sources reflect its widespread distribution in the diet, both in natural and processed forms. While some descriptions mention sodium in only a few foods, the majority affirm its presence across a broad spectrum of dietary items. Therefore, sodium is not only a critical component of human physiology but also a common dietary mineral found in diverse food groups, from fruits and vegetables to oils and processed goods. Its role in maintaining cellular and systemic functions makes it indispensable, even when present in small quantities in certain foods. Overall, sodium remains a fundamental electrolyte necessary for life, with its presence in both natural and processed foods contributing to the body’s ability to regulate fluid levels, transmit nerve impulses, and support muscle function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 534, "total_tokens": 947, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
