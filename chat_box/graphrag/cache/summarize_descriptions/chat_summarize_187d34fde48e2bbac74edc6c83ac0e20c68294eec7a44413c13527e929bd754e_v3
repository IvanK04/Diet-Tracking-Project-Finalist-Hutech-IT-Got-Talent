It is widely recognized for its nutrient-dense profile, offering significant amounts of essential vitamins and minerals. Broccoli is particularly rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as dietary fiber, calcium, and magnesium. These nutrients contribute to its reputation as a health-promoting food. The presence of vitamin C enhances immune function and supports skin health, while vitamin K plays a vital role in blood clotting and bone metabolism. Fiber aids in digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, broccoli contains sulfur compounds, such as sulforaphane, which have been associated with antioxidant properties and potential protective effects against chronic diseases. Its high concentration of antioxidants and phytonutrients makes it a valuable component of a balanced diet. While some descriptions emphasize its leafy green nature, the plant's primary edible portion—the compact, floret-like heads—aligns with the cabbage family classification, reinforcing its botanical identity. Overall, broccoli stands out as a versatile, nutritious, and widely consumed vegetable that supports overall well-being through its rich array of vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
