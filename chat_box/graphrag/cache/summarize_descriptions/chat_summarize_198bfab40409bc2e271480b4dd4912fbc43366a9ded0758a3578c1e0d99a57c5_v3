It includes well-known variations such as cháo gà (chicken porridge) and cháo ruốc thịt lợn (pork and fermented shrimp porridge), which are valued for their balanced nutrition and gentle impact on the digestive system. These dishes are integral to daily Vietnamese culinary practices, especially in rural and home-based settings where simplicity and health are prioritized.  \n\nIn addition to being a dietary category, SUP_CHAO is also associated with a broader culinary tradition and event culture, particularly in regions where communal meals are celebrated. Specific dishes like chao dou den duong (yellow porridge) and chao dou xanh (green porridge) are especially popular for their refreshing and revitalizing properties, often enjoyed during seasonal transitions or as part of cultural gatherings. These porridges are appreciated not only for their taste but also for their ability to provide energy and support overall well-being.  \n\nWhile the primary function of SUP_CHAO is as a nutritious breakfast option, its cultural significance extends beyond mere consumption. It reflects a deep-rooted connection between food, health, and community in Vietnamese households. The preparation of these dishes often involves family participation, reinforcing intergenerational bonds and traditional cooking methods.  \n\nDespite some variations in regional preparation—such as the use of different herbs, meats, or seasonings—SUP_CHAO remains consistent in its core attributes: simplicity, nutritional value, and digestibility. The inclusion of fermented ingredients like ruốc (fermented shrimp paste) adds a unique flavor profile while contributing to the dish’s probiotic benefits.  \n\nIt is important to note that while some descriptions emphasize SUP_CHAO as a breakfast staple, others highlight its role in cultural events, suggesting that it functions both as a daily meal and a social or ceremonial food. This dual role underscores its versatility and enduring presence in Vietnamese culinary life.  \n\nIn summary, SUP_CHAO is a multifaceted element of Vietnamese cuisine—serving as a nutritious, easily digestible breakfast dish and as a component of traditional culinary events. Its widespread appeal lies in its balance of health, flavor, and cultural significance, making it a foundational part of daily and communal Vietnamese food practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 465, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 685, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
