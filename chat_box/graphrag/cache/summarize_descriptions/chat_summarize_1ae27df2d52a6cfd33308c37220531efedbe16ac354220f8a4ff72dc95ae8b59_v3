This classification emphasizes minimal saturated fat, which contributes to overall dietary health by reducing the intake of fats linked to increased cholesterol and cardiovascular risks. The presence of low saturated fat supports a balanced and nutritious meal plan, particularly beneficial for those managing weight, cholesterol levels, or specific medical conditions such as heart disease. While the term \"low fat\" may be interpreted broadly, in the context of LOW_FAT, it specifically denotes a reduced amount of saturated fat, aligning with current dietary guidelines that promote healthier fat intake. This attribute does not imply the absence of all fats, but rather a controlled and health-conscious level of fat, primarily focusing on minimizing harmful saturated components. The LOW_FAT designation serves as a clear indicator for consumers seeking to make informed food choices that support long-term wellness. Overall, the LOW_FAT label reflects a commitment to nutritional quality and aligns with evidence-based recommendations for maintaining a healthy diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
