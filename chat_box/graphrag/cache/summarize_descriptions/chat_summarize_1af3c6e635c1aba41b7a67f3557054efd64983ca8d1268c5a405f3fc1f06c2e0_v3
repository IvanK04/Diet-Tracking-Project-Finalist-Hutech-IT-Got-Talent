It is rich in polyphenols and vitamin E, both of which contribute to its well-documented antioxidant properties. These compounds are believed to support cardiovascular health, helping to reduce bad cholesterol levels and promote overall heart wellness. The extraction method—cold pressing—ensures that the oil retains its nutritional integrity, minimizing the loss of beneficial compounds that can occur with high-heat or chemical processing. As a result, olive oil is widely recognized not only as a versatile culinary ingredient but also as a health-promoting food. Its high content of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, further supports healthy lipid profiles and may reduce inflammation in the body. The presence of polyphenols, such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, enhances its protective effects against oxidative stress and chronic diseases. While olive oil is commonly used in cooking, it is also valued in dietary supplements and traditional medicine for its potential to support longevity and metabolic health. The combination of its natural composition and proven health benefits makes olive oil a cornerstone of Mediterranean diets, which are associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease and improved overall well-being. Despite variations in quality and processing methods, the core nutritional profile of olive oil—centered on polyphenols, vitamin E, and heart-healthy fats—remains consistent across reputable sources. This consistency underscores its role as a vital component of both modern nutrition science and traditional dietary practices. Overall, olive oil stands out as a nutrient-dense, antioxidant-rich fat that supports long-term health when consumed as part of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 547, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
