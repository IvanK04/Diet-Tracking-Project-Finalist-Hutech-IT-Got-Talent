This tag is commonly applied to meals such as Phở bò tái gầu, Cơm rang, and Cơm rang dưa bò, which are recognized for their rich nutritional profiles and high caloric content. The designation of \"high energy\" serves both as a dietary classification and a health indicator, signaling that these dishes are suitable for individuals seeking to replenish energy stores, particularly during periods of physical activity or prolonged exertion.  \n\nThe term \"HIGH_ENERGY\" functions as a consistent descriptor across various meal types, emphasizing not only the caloric density but also the functional purpose of these foods in supporting sustained energy levels. It is not merely a label for food with high fat or carbohydrate content, but rather a holistic indicator of energy-providing properties, making it useful in nutritional planning and meal selection.  \n\nWhile some descriptions initially present HIGH_ENERGY as a standalone dietary category, others frame it as a health tag tied to specific meals, reinforcing its role in nutritional labeling and consumer guidance. These overlapping perspectives converge to establish a unified understanding: HIGH_ENERGY refers to food items that deliver substantial energy through their macronutrient composition—particularly carbohydrates and fats—making them ideal for energy-boosting meals.  \n\nThere are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions. All sources align in defining HIGH_ENERGY as a category denoting high caloric content and energy provision. The variations in phrasing—such as \"dietary category\" versus \"health tag\"—reflect different contextual uses but do not conflict; rather, they illustrate how the term is applied across nutritional frameworks. The consistency in core meaning—high calories, energy-boosting properties, and association with specific dishes—ensures a coherent and reliable definition.  \n\nIn practical terms, consumers and nutritionists can use the HIGH_ENERGY tag to identify meals that support physical performance, recovery, or daily energy demands. It is especially relevant in settings such as restaurants, meal planning apps, or fitness-related dietary recommendations where energy intake is a key consideration.  \n\nOverall, HIGH_ENERGY is a well-defined and functionally relevant category that bridges dietary classification and health functionality. It accurately reflects the energy-dense nature of dishes like Phở bò tái gầu and Cơm rang, which are known for their robust flavor and high caloric yield. By integrating both descriptive and functional aspects, the HIGH_ENERGY label provides clear, actionable information for individuals managing their energy needs through food choices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 522, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 737, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
