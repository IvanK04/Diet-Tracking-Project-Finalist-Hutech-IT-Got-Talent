They possess significantly less pungency than regular garlic, making them ideal for both raw applications—such as vinaigrettes—and slow-cooked dishes where they can caramelize to develop a rich, subtle depth. This delicate flavor profile allows shallots to enhance a wide range of culinary preparations without overpowering other ingredients, making them a favored component in French cuisine and various global dishes, particularly sauces and stir-fries.  \n\nEach shallot weighs approximately 49 grams and contains 72 calories, 2.5 grams of protein, 16.8 grams of carbohydrates, and only 0.1 grams of fat. Nutritionally, shallots are rich in essential vitamins, including A, C, D, E, and K, and are a valuable source of antioxidants such as quercetin, which contribute to their health benefits. Their versatility and balanced flavor profile make them a preferred choice for individuals who prioritize both flavor and nutrition in their cooking.  \n\nShallots are widely used in both raw and cooked forms, offering a nuanced aromatic quality that complements a variety of ingredients. Whether added to dressings, sauces, or stir-fries, they provide a subtle depth that enhances the overall taste without dominating the dish. Their use in French cuisine highlights their longstanding culinary significance, where they are valued for their ability to add complexity without intensity.  \n\nWhile some descriptions note their use as a type of onion, the most accurate classification is that shallots are a distinct allium species, sharing familial ties with onions and garlic but differing in flavor, texture, and culinary application. The consistent emphasis across all descriptions on their mildness, antioxidant content, and versatility confirms their role as a key ingredient in both traditional and modern cooking.  \n\nIn summary, shallots are a nutritious, aromatic allium with a mild, sweet flavor and high antioxidant content, widely appreciated in global cuisines—especially French cuisine—for their ability to enhance dishes with subtle depth and complexity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 427, "total_tokens": 859, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
