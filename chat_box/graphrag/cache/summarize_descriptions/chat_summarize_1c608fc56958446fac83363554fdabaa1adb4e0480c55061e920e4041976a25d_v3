These pearls are widely used to add texture and sweetness to drinks, often serving as a contrasting element to other gelatinous toppings like nha dam. While traditional jelly pearls offer a rich, chewy texture and a sweet flavor, they are notable for being high in calories and sugar, which makes them a less health-conscious choice compared to alternatives such as Xanh Jelly. Nha dam, in contrast, is regarded as a lighter, more refreshing option due to its lower calorie content and natural antioxidant properties. Despite their widespread use and appeal, traditional jelly pearls are generally considered a less nutritious option, especially when consumed regularly. Their production relies on starch and sugar, contributing to their caloric density and potential impact on blood sugar levels. The use of tapioca or similar starches provides a firm, gel-like consistency that distinguishes them from more delicate or naturally derived gelatinous products. While they are a staple in many Asian beverage cultures, their nutritional profile suggests that they should be consumed in moderation. In comparison to low-calorie alternatives like Xanh Jelly, traditional jelly pearls offer a more indulgent experience but lack the health benefits associated with lower-sugar, antioxidant-rich options. Overall, traditional jelly pearls remain a culturally significant and widely enjoyed component of Asian beverages, valued for their taste and texture, yet they are often viewed as a less healthy choice in modern dietary considerations. Their popularity persists due to their familiar appeal and versatility in both sweet and savory drink preparations, though awareness of their nutritional implications is growing among health-conscious consumers.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
