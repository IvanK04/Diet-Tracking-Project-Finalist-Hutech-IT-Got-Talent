It is consistently listed in the allergen sections of these dishes, indicating its presence as a key ingredient or component. The inclusion of soy in these dishes highlights its role not only as a dietary ingredient but also as a potential trigger for allergic reactions in individuals with soy intolerance or allergies. \n\nWhile soy is not a primary ingredient in all of these dishes, its presence is recognized and documented in official allergen disclosures, suggesting that it may be introduced through processed components such as soy sauce, soy protein, or other derived products used in preparation. For instance, in Phở mixed with chicken, soy may be present in the form of soy-based broths or seasonings, while in Miến riêu cua (trộn), it could be part of the sauce or seasoning blend. Similarly, in Bánh mỳ chảo lợn, soy may be used in the form of soy sauce or as a component in the bread or filling, contributing to its allergen profile.\n\nThe consistent identification of soy across these diverse dishes underscores its prevalence in Vietnamese cuisine, particularly in dishes that incorporate rich, savory sauces or processed ingredients. This widespread presence makes soy a critical consideration for individuals with food allergies, especially those with known sensitivities or intolerances to soy proteins. Allergic responses to soy can range from mild symptoms such as hives or digestive discomfort to more severe reactions like anaphylaxis, emphasizing the importance of clear allergen labeling and awareness.\n\nDespite the variation in dish types, the data shows no contradiction in the presence of soy as an allergen. All descriptions align in identifying soy as a component in the allergen list of each dish, reinforcing its role as a recognized and documented allergen. There is no conflicting information suggesting soy is absent or present only in certain conditions; rather, the evidence consistently points to its inclusion in these specific culinary preparations.\n\nIn summary, SOY is a well-documented food allergen found in multiple Vietnamese dishes, including Phở mixed with chicken, Miến riêu cua (trộn), and Bánh mỳ chảo lợn. Its presence is formally listed in allergen disclosures, reflecting its use in sauces, seasonings, or processed ingredients. Given its potential to trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, awareness of soy in these dishes is essential for food safety and consumer health. The information collected from all descriptions supports a unified and coherent picture: soy is a common allergen in these dishes, and its inclusion should be clearly communicated to ensure the safety of those with soy-related sensitivities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 556, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 793, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
