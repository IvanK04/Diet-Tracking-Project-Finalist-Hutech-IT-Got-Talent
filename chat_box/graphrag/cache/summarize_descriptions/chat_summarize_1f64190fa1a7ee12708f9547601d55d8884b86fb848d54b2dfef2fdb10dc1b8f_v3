It is vital for maintaining proper nerve signaling and blood pressure, and is found in a wide variety of foods, including fish, seafood such as scallops and sea bass, poultry like chicken breast and pork belly, processed foods, table salt, and various vegetables and herbs including dill, ngò tây, ngò rí, tía tô, and kinh giới. Sodium is also present in plant-based sources such as soybeans, red pepper flakes, mushrooms, paprika, red beets, parsnips, chili peppers, and even in fruits like pears and sầu riêng, though typically in small quantities. It contributes to flavor and texture in foods such as fried chicken-style northeast, Vietnamese Balm and Beef, dưa cải muối, and cooked duck, and is a notable component in sauces like chicken stock sauce and glass noodles. While sodium is naturally present in many foods, including artichokes, tapioca flour, young coconut squares, and ridge gourd, its consumption should be moderated, especially in individuals managing blood pressure. Although present in low amounts in certain vegetables and herbs, sodium remains a significant component in processed and cooked foods. Its presence in both animal and plant-based products underscores its widespread distribution in the diet. Overall, sodium is a fundamental mineral necessary for physiological functions, with its intake varying widely depending on food sources and preparation methods.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 915, "total_tokens": 1216, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
