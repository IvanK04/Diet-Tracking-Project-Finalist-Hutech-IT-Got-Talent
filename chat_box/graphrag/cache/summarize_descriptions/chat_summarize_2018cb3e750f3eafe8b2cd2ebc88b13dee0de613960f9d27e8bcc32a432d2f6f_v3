It plays a crucial role in overall bodily functions, including heart health, nerve signaling, and muscle activity. While potassium is not a physical entity in the traditional sense, it is widely distributed in various foods, contributing to physiological balance and well-being. It is found in diverse dietary sources such as grapes and other fruits, seaweed, chicken thighs, soup powder, and in the traditional Vietnamese dish Nộm rau muống. In these foods, potassium supports essential processes like fluid regulation, nerve transmission, and muscle function. Its presence in both plant-based and animal-based foods underscores its broad dietary availability. Although the descriptions emphasize potassium’s role in supporting heart health and bodily functions, they consistently affirm its importance in maintaining physiological equilibrium. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all align in highlighting potassium’s nutritional significance and its presence across different food items. The mineral is particularly notable in dishes like Nộm rau muống, where it contributes to fluid balance and overall bodily function. Additionally, its presence in common foods such as soup powder and chicken thighs demonstrates its accessibility and relevance in everyday diets. Potassium’s function as a nutrient, rather than a physical substance, is consistently emphasized, reinforcing its role as a key component in human nutrition. In summary, potassium is a fundamental mineral nutrient found in a wide range of foods, including fruits, seafood, meats, and traditional dishes like Nộm rau muống. It supports critical physiological processes such as nerve and muscle function, fluid balance, and cardiovascular health, making it an indispensable element in maintaining optimal bodily function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 637, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
