It plays a critical role in supporting both bone health and immune function. The body synthesizes Vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight, specifically ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, making sun exposure a key natural source. Additionally, Vitamin D can be obtained through dietary sources such as fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, and tuna), egg yolks, and fortified foods including milk, cereals, and plant-based alternatives. Its importance extends beyond skeletal development, as it contributes to the regulation of immune responses, helping to protect against infections and modulate inflammatory processes. While sunlight exposure is a primary method of Vitamin D production, dietary intake and supplements may be necessary for individuals with limited sun exposure or specific medical conditions. Overall, Vitamin D is a vital nutrient that supports multiple physiological functions, with its deficiency linked to conditions such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, as well as increased susceptibility to certain diseases. Despite some descriptions not explicitly mentioning immune function, this role is well-supported by scientific evidence and is now widely recognized as a key aspect of Vitamin D’s biological activity. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of Vitamin D includes its synthesis via sunlight, dietary sources, and its dual importance in bone metabolism and immune regulation. This makes Vitamin D a crucial nutrient in both preventive health and clinical management of various disorders.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
