As a type of poultry product, they are valued for their nutritional profile and are considered a high-quality source of protein, essential vitamins, and vital minerals. Each large egg contains about 143 calories, 12.6 grams of protein, and only 0.72 grams of carbohydrates, making them a nutrient-dense food option with a low glycemic impact. The shell of large eggs provides natural protection, preserving freshness and integrity during storage and handling.\n\nNutritionally, large eggs are rich in a variety of essential vitamins, including thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), vitamin B6, folate (vitamin B9), and choline—a nutrient critical for brain health and fetal development. In addition to vitamins, they contain a broad spectrum of minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, and selenium. These micronutrients support numerous physiological functions, including immune function, bone health, energy metabolism, and cellular repair.\n\nThe consistent weight of 50 grams per large egg makes them a standard reference point in food labeling and dietary planning. Their balanced macronutrient and micronutrient composition positions them as a versatile ingredient in both home cooking and commercial food production. Whether used in baking, scrambling, or as a base for omelets, large eggs contribute significantly to the nutritional value of meals.\n\nDespite the repetition in the provided descriptions, there are no contradictory elements. All information aligns in confirming the size, nutritional content, and health benefits of large eggs. The data consistently emphasizes their high protein content, low carbohydrate levels, and rich vitamin and mineral profile. The mention of the natural shell serves to highlight their structural integrity and shelf life, which is important for both consumers and producers.\n\nIn summary, LARGE EGGS are a nutritionally complete and widely consumed poultry product, offering a balanced mix of macronutrients and essential micronutrients. With their standard size, reliable nutritional composition, and natural protective shell, large eggs remain a staple in diets worldwide, supporting overall health and well-being. Their role in providing high-quality protein and vital nutrients makes them a key component in both individual and population-level nutritional strategies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 488, "prompt_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 875, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
