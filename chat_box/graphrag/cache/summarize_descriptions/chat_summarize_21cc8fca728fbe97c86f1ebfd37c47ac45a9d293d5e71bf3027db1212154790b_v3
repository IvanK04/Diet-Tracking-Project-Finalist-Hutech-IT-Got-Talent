The flesh is typically consumed raw, mashed, or pressed to extract its natural, sterile coconut water, which contains essential electrolytes such as potassium and is known for its hydrating properties. The white flesh of the coconut provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of saturated fat that is metabolized differently than long-chain fats, offering potential benefits for energy and metabolism. While coconut is often associated with high calorie content—such as a 50-gram serving containing 354 calories—it is naturally cholesterol-free, gluten-free, and low in fat. It is a rich source of various vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex vitamins, as well as essential minerals like iron, zinc, copper, potassium, and magnesium. Despite some descriptions suggesting the flesh is soft and sweet, others note its firm texture, which requires splitting the hard shell to access the edible portion. This process is necessary to obtain the flesh, which can be eaten directly or used in a variety of food products. Although one description claims coconut is low in fat, another highlights its high calorie content, which may reflect the concentration of fats in the flesh rather than a general deficiency. This apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that while coconut is low in fat compared to other fats, it contains a significant amount of energy due to its MCTs and overall caloric density. The fruit's natural, sterile coconut water contributes to its hydrating qualities and low sodium content, making it a beneficial beverage option. Overall, coconut is a versatile and nutritious tropical fruit widely used in culinary applications and valued for its unique nutritional profile, including its electrolyte content, vitamins, and metabolic properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 370, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 729, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
