This marbling contributes not only to the mouthfeel but also to the deep, savory taste that distinguishes the ribeye from other beef cuts. The cut is particularly valued in culinary contexts for its ability to deliver a satisfying, juicy experience when cooked properly. RIBEYE is a rich source of essential nutrients, including high-quality protein and vitamin B12, both of which play critical roles in maintaining bodily functions such as red blood cell formation, nerve function, and energy metabolism.  \n\nIn terms of nutritional composition, a 227-gram serving of ribeye contains 26.4 grams of protein and 24.2 grams of fat, with no carbohydrates. This high-fat content, while contributing to its flavor and tenderness, should be considered in dietary planning, especially for individuals monitoring fat intake. Despite the significant fat content, the protein and B12 levels make ribeye a valuable source of essential nutrients, particularly for those seeking a nutrient-dense meat option.  \n\nThe cut is typically sourced from the rib section of the cow and is often sold as a steak or in larger roasts. Its popularity stems from its balance of flavor, texture, and nutritional value, making it a favorite among meat enthusiasts and professional chefs alike. However, due to its high fat content, it is recommended to prepare ribeye using methods that preserve its juiciness while minimizing excess fat, such as slow cooking, searing, or grilling.  \n\nWhile some sources emphasize the nutritional benefits of ribeye, including its high protein and B12 content, others highlight its substantial fat content, which may be a concern for certain dietary regimens. These points are not contradictory but rather complementary—highlighting the dual nature of the cut: a flavorful, nutrient-rich food that also contains a significant amount of fat. The presence of both protein and fat underscores its role as a complete source of macronutrients, though consumers should be mindful of portion sizes and dietary goals when incorporating ribeye into their meals.  \n\nIn summary, RIBEYE is a premium beef cut celebrated for its marbled fat, rich flavor, and tender texture. It provides essential nutrients such as protein and vitamin B12, making it a valuable component of a balanced diet. With 26.4 grams of protein and 24.2 grams of fat per 227 grams, it offers a dense source of macronutrients, though its high fat content requires careful consideration in dietary planning. Its culinary appeal and nutritional profile make it a staple in many kitchens, particularly where flavor and quality are prioritized.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 554, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 787, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
