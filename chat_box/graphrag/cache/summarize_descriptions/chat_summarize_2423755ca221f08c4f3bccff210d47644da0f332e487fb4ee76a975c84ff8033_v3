This flavorful dish is characterized by its high fat and protein content—specifically, 68.2g of fat and 50.3g of protein per serving—making it a dense, energy-rich meal. It is also low in carbohydrates, containing only 7.3g per serving, and includes essential nutrients such as calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C. The dish contains a notable amount of sodium, classifying it as a high-sodium food, and is often categorized as a weight-gain dish due to its high caloric and fat content. Additionally, it contains cholesterol, which should be considered by individuals managing cardiovascular health.\n\nOne notable ingredient in THỊT LỢN XÁ XÍU is fish sauce, which contributes to its savory flavor but may trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This allergen is a key consideration for those with fish or seafood sensitivities. While the dish is rich in macronutrients, particularly protein and fat, its nutritional profile reflects a balance between essential nutrients and potential health concerns. The use of honey and garlic adds both flavor and minor health benefits, such as antioxidant properties, though these are secondary to the dish’s primary nutritional composition.\n\nDespite some variations in preparation, the core ingredients and nutritional characteristics remain consistent across most recipes. The dish is widely consumed in Vietnamese cuisine and is valued for its taste and satiating nature. However, due to its high fat, protein, and sodium content, it is recommended to consume THỊT LỢN XÁ XÍU in moderation, especially by individuals managing weight, blood pressure, or food allergies. For those with known allergies to fish or seafood, the presence of fish sauce presents a clear dietary restriction.\n\nIn summary, THỊT LỢN XÁ XÍU is a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate meal that provides essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C. It is rich in energy and cholesterol, and contains a significant amount of sodium, which may impact health if consumed excessively. While it is a beloved and flavorful dish in Vietnamese culinary tradition, its nutritional profile necessitates mindful consumption, particularly for individuals with dietary restrictions or health conditions. The inclusion of fish sauce, while enhancing flavor, introduces a potential allergen that must be acknowledged. Overall, THỊT LỢN XÁ XÍU remains a staple in meals for those seeking a savory, protein-dense, and satisfying dish, but its health implications should be balanced with dietary awareness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 561, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 897, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
