Unlike processed honey, raw honey is unrefined and unheated, preserving its natural enzymes, antioxidants, and beneficial compounds. It contains 78.7 grams of carbohydrates per 21 grams of weight, 0.3 grams of protein, and no fat, making it a low-fat, energy-dense food source. Raw honey is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, including niacin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, riboflavin, and vitamin B6, contributing to its appeal in both culinary and health-oriented applications. The flavor and texture of raw honey vary significantly depending on the types of flowers from which bees collect nectar, resulting in a diverse range of tastes and consistencies—such as floral, fruity, or earthy—across different regions and seasons. This natural variation enhances its versatility in cooking, baking, and traditional remedies. Due to its unprocessed nature, raw honey is often valued for its potential health benefits, including immune support and anti-inflammatory properties, attributed to its antioxidant content and bioactive enzymes. While some sources emphasize its role as a natural sweetener with health-promoting qualities, others highlight its culinary uses, reinforcing its dual significance in both daily diets and wellness practices. The presence of enzymes such as glucose oxidase, which is naturally found in raw honey, is absent in heated or pasteurized forms, further distinguishing raw honey from processed alternatives. These enzymes contribute to the honey’s antibacterial properties and may play a role in supporting digestive health. Despite its natural composition, it is important to note that raw honey should not be given to infants under one year of age due to the risk of botulism. Overall, raw honey stands out as a minimally processed, nutrient-rich product that combines natural sweetness with functional benefits, making it a popular choice among health-conscious consumers and culinary professionals alike. Its unique characteristics—flavor, texture, and nutritional profile—make it a distinctive ingredient in both home kitchens and traditional medicine.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 709, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
