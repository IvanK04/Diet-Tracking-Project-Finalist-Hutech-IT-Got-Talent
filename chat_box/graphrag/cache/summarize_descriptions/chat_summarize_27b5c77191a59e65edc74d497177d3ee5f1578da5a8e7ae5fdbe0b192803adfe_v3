Botanically classified under seeds and legumes, coffee beans are a food product that typically weigh 50 grams per serving. Nutritionally, they contain 518 calories, 8 grams of protein, 63 grams of carbohydrates, 26 grams of fat, and provide vitamins C and A. They also include essential minerals such as iron, sodium, and calcium. While the product is labeled as high in minerals and contains a moderate amount of protein, it is notably high in calories, saturated fat, and sugar. Despite claims of being low in vitamins, the presence of vitamins C and A indicates a moderate vitamin content, suggesting a more balanced profile than initially stated. The nutritional composition reflects a high-energy, nutrient-dense food with significant fat and carbohydrate content, making it a popular choice for morning consumption. However, due to its high saturated fat and sugar levels, consumption should be moderated, especially for individuals managing weight or cardiovascular health. The processing methods—such as roasting and grinding—alter the flavor, aroma, and nutritional profile, but do not fundamentally change the seed origin. Overall, coffee beans serve both as a culinary ingredient and a source of essential nutrients, though their high caloric and fat content requires mindful consumption. The combination of their botanical origin, processing versatility, and nutritional profile positions coffee beans as a staple in global diets, particularly in morning routines. While some descriptions suggest low vitamin content, the inclusion of vitamins C and A corrects this, indicating a more balanced nutritional value. Thus, coffee beans are best understood as a processed legume seed with a complex nutritional profile, offering both energy and key minerals, while requiring moderation due to elevated fat and sugar levels.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 654, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
