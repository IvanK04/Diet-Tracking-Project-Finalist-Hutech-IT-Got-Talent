It plays a critical role in supporting fetal development, cellular health, and overall growth processes. Found in a wide variety of dietary sources, FOLATE_DFE is commonly present in leafy greens, green vegetables, legumes, fortified grains, and certain animal products such as fish, tofu, scallops, and corn. It is also detected in specific herbs and plants, including bưởi chùm (pompom fruit), ngò tây (coriander), cải bó xôi (Chinese cabbage), and peanut butter. While its primary functions are linked to DNA synthesis and cell division, its presence in diverse foods—ranging from plant-based sources like leafy greens and legumes to animal-based options such as fish and scallops—demonstrates broad dietary availability. Although some descriptions mention strawberries as a source, this appears to be an error or misattribution, as strawberries are not a significant or well-documented source of folate compared to leafy greens and legumes. The consistent emphasis across multiple descriptions on its role in cell division and fetal development underscores its biological importance. FOLATE_DFE is particularly crucial during periods of rapid cell growth, such as pregnancy and infancy. Its presence in both plant and animal-based foods makes it accessible across various dietary patterns. Despite minor inconsistencies in specific food sources, the overarching theme remains consistent: FOLATE_DFE is a fundamental nutrient for cellular function and development, widely distributed in common foods like leafy greens, legumes, tofu, and fortified grains. The entity FOLATE_DFE is thus best understood as a versatile and essential nutrient supporting fundamental biological processes through its presence in a diverse range of natural and processed foods.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 409, "total_tokens": 777, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
