This characteristic is essential for individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, as consumption of gluten can lead to adverse health effects such as intestinal damage or digestive discomfort. Foods that are classified as GLUTEN_FREE do not contain detectable levels of gluten and are considered safe for consumption by those with gluten-related disorders. Examples of naturally gluten-free foods include long grain white rice, quinoa, and mustard greens, all of which are inherently free from gluten and suitable for inclusion in gluten-sensitive diets. Additionally, certain seafood products such as Tôm đông lạnh (frozen shrimp) and Cá ngừ vây vàng sống (fresh yellowfin tuna) are also labeled as GLUTEN_FREE, indicating that they do not contain gluten, either due to their natural composition or because they are processed in gluten-free environments. While gluten is not naturally present in these foods, it is important to verify processing conditions, especially for products that may be cross-contaminated during manufacturing. The presence of gluten-free attributes in diverse food categories—ranging from grains and vegetables to seafood—demonstrates the broad applicability of this dietary label. However, it is critical to note that while these foods are naturally or processed to be gluten-free, consumers should still check labels to ensure safety, particularly when consuming products that may be exposed to gluten-containing ingredients during production. Overall, GLUTEN_FREE serves as a vital indicator for safe, inclusive food choices in modern diets, supporting the health and well-being of individuals with gluten-related conditions. This attribute is not only relevant to staple grains but extends to a wide variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, reinforcing its importance in both dietary planning and food labeling standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 621, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
