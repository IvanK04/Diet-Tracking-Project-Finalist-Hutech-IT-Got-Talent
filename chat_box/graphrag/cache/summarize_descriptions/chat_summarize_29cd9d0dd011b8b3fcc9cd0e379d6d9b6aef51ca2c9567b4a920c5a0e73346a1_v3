This product is specifically formulated to include SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG, which is a concentrated, sweetened yogurt variant commonly used in traditional recipes. The inclusion of SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG not only provides a rich, creamy texture but also contributes to the characteristic sweetness and tanginess that define the flavor profile of KEM SỮA CHUA TRÂN CHÂU. Both ingredients are integral to the dish, with SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG serving as the foundational base upon which the overall structure and taste of the dessert are built. While the two entities are distinct—SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG being a standalone product and KEM SỮA CHUA TRÂN CHÂU being a finished dessert—their relationship is clearly defined by functional integration. There is no contradiction between the descriptions, as both affirm that SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG is used in the preparation of KEM SỮA CHUA TRÂN CHÂU, and that sweetened yogurt is a key ingredient in the latter. This confirms a consistent and logical ingredient dependency. The final product, KEM SỮA CHUA TRÂN CHÂU, is thus a composite dessert that relies on the specific qualities of sweetened yogurt, particularly in its concentrated form as SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG, to deliver a balanced and appealing flavor experience. The use of this ingredient aligns with traditional Vietnamese dessert practices, where sweetness and tanginess are carefully balanced to enhance palatability. In summary, SỮA CHUA ĐẶC CÓ ĐƯỜNG is not merely an optional addition but a core component in the formulation of KEM SỮA CHUA TRÂN CHÂU, making it a fundamental element in the dish’s identity and taste. This relationship underscores the interdependence between the two entities within the broader context of Vietnamese confectionery culture.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 455, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
