It plays a critical role in supporting skin health, immune function, and overall cellular integrity. Found in a variety of dietary sources including almonds, sunflower seeds, salmon, and oils such as peanut and coconut oil, Vitamin E is widely recognized for its ability to preserve the integrity of cell membranes. Its presence in foods like bơ tươi (fresh coconut oil) and dầu mè (peanut oil) further underscores its broad dietary availability. As both a nutrient and a natural preservative, Vitamin E is commonly included in nutritional data and is considered a key component of essential vitamins and antioxidants. While some descriptions mention its presence in specific foods like salmon and almonds, others reference oils such as coconut and peanut, which are consistent with its known dietary sources. The Vietnamese term \"Vitamin E là một chất chống oxy hóa có mặt trong dầu mè và dầu dừa\" aligns with the broader context, confirming its presence in these oils and reinforcing its role in cellular protection. All descriptions converge on the core functions of Vitamin E: antioxidant activity, support of skin and immune health, and protection against oxidative stress. Although minor variations in food examples exist, they do not contradict the central scientific understanding of Vitamin E’s biological role. Thus, the comprehensive summary reflects a unified and coherent picture of Vitamin E as a vital, naturally occurring antioxidant that contributes to human health through its protective effects on cells and tissues. Its presence across diverse food sources ensures accessibility and relevance in both dietary and supplement contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 665, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
