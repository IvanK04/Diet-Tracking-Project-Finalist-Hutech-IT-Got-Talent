With a typical weight of 70 grams, chestnuts contain 186 calories, 3 grams of protein, 39.7 grams of carbohydrates, and only 1.1 grams of fat. Their sweet, soft texture when cooked makes them a popular snack and a key ingredient in traditional dishes across various cultures. Chestnuts are particularly valued for their nutritional profile, serving as a good source of several essential vitamins and minerals. These include biotin, niacin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and pantothenic acid. Mineral content is also diverse and includes iron, zinc, copper, sodium, calcium, selenium, magnesium, manganese, and potassium. While chestnuts are often associated with plant-based diets, they are naturally vegan-friendly, making them a healthy and accessible option for individuals seeking plant-based nutrition. Their high carbohydrate content positions them as a valuable energy source, especially in traditional cuisines where they are used in baked goods, stews, and roasted preparations. Despite some variations in reported nutritional values, the consistent presence of vitamin C and a broad spectrum of B-vitamins and minerals across the descriptions supports their role as a nutrient-dense food. Although one description notes chestnuts as a source of vitamin C, another emphasizes their low fat and high carbohydrate content, which aligns with the broader understanding of their composition. There is no contradiction in the data; rather, the descriptions reinforce each other, highlighting chestnuts' unique balance of macronutrients and micronutrients. The emphasis on their low fat and high carbohydrate content is consistent with their culinary use and nutritional function. Chestnuts are not only a snack but also a staple in traditional food systems, particularly in regions such as Europe, Asia, and parts of North America. Their nutritional benefits, combined with their pleasant taste when properly prepared, make them a versatile and wholesome food choice. Overall, CHESTNUTS stand out as a nutritious, plant-based food that provides sustained energy and essential nutrients, making them a valuable component of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 456, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 845, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
