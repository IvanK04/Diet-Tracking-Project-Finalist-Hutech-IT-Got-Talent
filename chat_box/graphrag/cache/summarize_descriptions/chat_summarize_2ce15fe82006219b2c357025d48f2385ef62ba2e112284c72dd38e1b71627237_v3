It acts as a coenzyme in various biochemical reactions, particularly those involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates to produce cellular energy. Thiamin is essential for maintaining optimal nerve function, supporting brain health, and ensuring the efficient operation of the central and peripheral nervous systems. As a vital nutrient, it contributes to overall metabolic balance and helps prevent deficiencies that can lead to neurological disorders such as beriberi. Thiamin is naturally found in a variety of foods, including coconut and mango, making it accessible through a balanced diet. Its presence in these fruits highlights its role in promoting both general well-being and specific physiological functions. The vitamin's solubility in water means it is not stored in significant amounts in the body and must be regularly consumed to maintain adequate levels. This characteristic underscores the importance of consistent dietary intake to support ongoing metabolic and neurological processes. Overall, Thiamin (B1) serves as a foundational nutrient in human health, bridging energy production and nervous system integrity through its active participation in key enzymatic pathways.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
