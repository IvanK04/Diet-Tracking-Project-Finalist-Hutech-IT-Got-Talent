It supports vital physiological processes including iron metabolism, nerve function, and immune and metabolic functions. Copper is found in a wide variety of dietary sources, both animal-based and plant-based. These include animal products such as fish, shellfish (e.g., scallops), pork belly, pork mince, chicken breast, and sea bass; as well as plant-based foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, vegetables (e.g., parsnips, chili peppers, asparagus, artichoke, red cabbage, ridge gourd, ngò tây, cải bó xôi), and certain fruits and grains (e.g., corn, tapioca flour). It is also present in specific foods such as peanut butter and soybeans. Copper contributes to overall health by supporting enzymatic activity, protecting cells from oxidative damage, and facilitating energy production. While it is commonly associated with animal-based foods, it is also widely available in plant-based diets, including vegetables, nuts, and whole grains. The mineral's presence in diverse foods such as glass noodles, egg noodles, and shallots further underscores its broad dietary availability. Although some descriptions mention copper in specific foods like pork ears, this detail is less common and may reflect a rare or regional dietary source. Overall, copper is a vital micronutrient involved in multiple biological functions, and its inclusion in a wide range of foods ensures that it can be obtained through varied dietary patterns. Its role in red blood cell formation and antioxidant activity makes it indispensable for maintaining healthy blood and cellular function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 1046, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
