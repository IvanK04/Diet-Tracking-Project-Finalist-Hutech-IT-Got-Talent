This tag is applied to various menu items, including Cơm rang and Miến riêu cua (nước), indicating that these foods have significant carbohydrate content. Carbohydrates in these dishes serve as a primary source of energy for the body, supporting physical activity and daily metabolic functions. However, due to their high concentration, these foods may also contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess, particularly when combined with insufficient physical activity or a balanced diet. The presence of the HIGH_CARBS tag helps consumers make informed dietary choices based on their health goals, such as managing energy levels, maintaining stable blood sugar, or controlling body weight. While carbohydrates are essential for bodily functions, the tag serves as a warning to individuals who need to monitor their intake—such as those with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or specific dietary restrictions. The consistency across descriptions confirms that HIGH_CARBS is not merely a descriptive label but a functional health indicator tied directly to nutritional composition. It reflects both the energy-providing benefits and potential risks associated with high-carbohydrate consumption. The tag is applied uniformly across different dishes, suggesting a standardized approach to nutritional labeling within the menu system. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all information aligns in emphasizing the role of carbohydrates in energy provision and the associated health considerations. Therefore, HIGH_CARBS functions as a clear, consistent, and informative health designation that enables users to understand the nutritional profile of specific dishes. This tag supports transparency in food labeling and promotes healthier eating habits by highlighting key dietary components. In summary, HIGH_CARBS is a well-defined health indicator that identifies dishes with elevated carbohydrate levels, balancing the recognized benefits of carbohydrates as an energy source with the potential for contributing to weight gain when consumed in excess. It is particularly relevant for individuals managing their dietary intake and seeking to align their food choices with specific health objectives.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
