This characteristic flavor is most pronounced when the onion is raw, but undergoes a significant transformation during cooking. When roasted, stir-fried, or sautéed—especially until caramelized—the onion develops a milder, sweeter, and more aromatic profile, making it a versatile ingredient in global cuisines. This shift in flavor makes it suitable for a wide range of culinary applications, from savory stews to baked dishes.  \n\nONION is a nutritious food, providing a good source of vitamin C, antioxidants such as quercetin, and prebiotic fiber, all while being very low in calories. Its health benefits are attributed to these bioactive compounds, which support immune function and promote digestive health.  \n\nDifferent varieties of ONION offer distinct culinary properties. Red onions are typically consumed raw, prized for their crisp texture and vibrant color, making them ideal in salads, sandwiches, and garnishes. Yellow onions, on the other hand, are best suited for cooking due to their robust flavor and ability to develop depth when sautéed or roasted. White onions are commonly used in salsas and other Mexican-style dishes, where they contribute a more subtle, earthy flavor that complements other ingredients.  \n\nDespite its strong raw aroma, the ONION is a foundational flavoring ingredient in diverse culinary traditions around the world. Its adaptability—shifting from pungent to sweet upon cooking—makes it a staple in both home kitchens and professional gastronomy. Whether used in raw form for freshness or cooked to enhance complexity, ONION remains a key component in global cuisine, valued not only for its flavor but also for its nutritional profile.  \n\nIn summary, ONION is a nutrient-rich, flavorful root vegetable whose taste and texture vary significantly depending on preparation and variety, making it an essential and versatile ingredient in a wide array of dishes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 408, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 710, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
