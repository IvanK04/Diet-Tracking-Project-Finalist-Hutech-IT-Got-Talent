It is categorized under oils and seasonings and functions as a natural flavoring agent in a wide range of culinary applications. As a key ingredient in the production of brown sugar, molasses contributes significantly to its distinctive flavor profile and rich, deep taste. It is also valued for its nutritional content, containing notable amounts of potassium and various B-vitamins, making it a source of essential minerals and nutrients. While it is commonly used as a natural sweetener, especially in baked goods such as bread, cookies, and cereals, its role extends beyond sweetness—molasses adds depth and complexity to recipes. Although it contains a small mineral content, this is generally considered a minor component compared to its primary contributions in flavor and texture. The nutritional benefits of molasses are often highlighted in health-focused diets, where it is promoted as a functional food ingredient. Despite some variations in the reported mineral content across sources, the consensus is that molasses provides a modest but meaningful amount of essential nutrients. Its use in food production is well-established, and it remains a staple in both traditional and modern cooking. Overall, molasses serves as both a functional and nutritional component in the food industry, bridging the gap between industrial byproduct and culinary ingredient. Its unique characteristics—flavor, texture, and nutritional value—make it a versatile and widely utilized substance in the food supply chain. While it is not a primary source of calories or macronutrients, its role in enhancing flavor and contributing to the nutritional profile of processed foods underscores its importance in food science and home cooking. MOLASSES is thus recognized not only as a byproduct of sugar refining but also as a valuable, multifaceted ingredient in both commercial and household food applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
