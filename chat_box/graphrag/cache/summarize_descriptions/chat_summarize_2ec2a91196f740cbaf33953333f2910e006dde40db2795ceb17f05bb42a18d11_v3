It is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, such as bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, chicken livers, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, and carp. These diverse food sources highlight the broad dietary availability of niacin, supporting its role in maintaining metabolic balance and promoting healthy skin. The vitamin plays a critical role in converting food into energy through the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, making it vital for overall energy production in the body. Additionally, niacin contributes to the integrity and function of the skin, helping to maintain its barrier properties and support skin health. While some descriptions mention niacin in relation to coconut water and bean sprouts, others reference more traditional sources like chicken livers and nuts, all of which align with the established nutritional profile of niacin. There is no contradiction among the descriptions, as they collectively reinforce the vitamin’s presence in both plant-based and animal-based foods and its consistent role in metabolic and dermatological health. The inclusion of both plant and animal sources underscores the versatility of niacin in the human diet. Overall, niacin is a fundamental nutrient that supports energy metabolism and skin integrity, and its presence in a wide range of foods ensures that it can be readily obtained through a balanced diet. Its importance in maintaining bodily functions makes it a key component of nutritional health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
