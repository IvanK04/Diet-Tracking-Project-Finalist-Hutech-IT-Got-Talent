It plays a key role in osmotic balance and ensures proper signaling within the nervous system. Sodium is naturally present in a wide variety of foods, including black beans, almonds, chicken livers, bean sprouts, coconut water, pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and whole wheat flour. While it is found in small amounts in these foods, it is present in higher concentrations in processed or salted items such as salt, wonton noodles, and beef dry meat, which is often salted during preparation. These sources contribute to sodium intake, with excessive consumption being strongly linked to elevated blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Foods with low sodium content, such as unsalted sunflower seeds and whole wheat flour, are considered healthier options for individuals managing blood pressure or reducing sodium intake. Although sodium is necessary for physiological functions, its overconsumption—particularly from processed and preserved foods—can have adverse health effects. In some contexts, such as in traditional dishes like chè thái or pineapple juice, sodium is present in modest amounts and supports basic bodily functions. The mineral is also found in animal products like chicken livers and plant-based sources like black beans and almonds. In Vietnamese, sodium is described as a mineral present in \"dồi huyết\" (blood-rich foods), emphasizing its role in maintaining electrolyte balance. Overall, sodium is a fundamental nutrient involved in multiple physiological processes, but its dietary intake must be carefully managed to avoid health complications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 539, "total_tokens": 866, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
