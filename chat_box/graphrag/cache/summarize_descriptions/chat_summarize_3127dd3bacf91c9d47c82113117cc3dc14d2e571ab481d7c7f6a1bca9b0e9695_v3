This category encompasses a wide range of dishes, including Pomegranate Juice, Pear Juice, nước mía, Bì lợn, Thịt bò khô, Bánh tôm, Lạc rang, Lòng xào dưa, Gan xào giá, cà phê trứng, chè vừng đen, Cá trôi rán sốt cà chua, Cá rô đồng rán, Cá rô phi rán, kem sữa chua trân châu, háo cảo hấp, miến lươn nước, miến lươn trộn, and Cháo thịt, among others. These dishes are selected for their ability to provide balanced macronutrient profiles, typically featuring high carbohydrate content, moderate protein and fat levels, and rich sources of essential vitamins such as vitamin A.  \n\nThe GIỮ_CÂN category is characterized by a moderate-energy meal plan that is low in fat, gluten-free, and dairy-free, promoting sustained energy without promoting weight gain. It is particularly effective in supporting metabolic balance and overall well-being. Dishes like thịt lợn nạc xay hầm are noted for their balanced nutritional profile, combining moderate protein and fat with essential nutrients, while seafood-based options such as salmon are highlighted for their omega-3 and vitamin D content, which support heart and brain health.  \n\nAlthough some descriptions initially suggest high carbohydrate and moderate fat content, the overarching theme remains consistent: GIỮ_CÂN is not a restrictive diet but a balanced approach to eating that supports stable body weight through controlled energy intake and nutrient diversity. It is applicable across various meal types, including main courses, snacks, and beverages, and is especially relevant for individuals seeking sustainable weight management.  \n\nNotably, GIỮ_CÂN is not limited to a single cuisine or region, as it includes both traditional Vietnamese dishes like Bánh tráng trộn and modern or processed items such as kem sữa chua trân châu. The category is also linked to specific dietary events or meal plans, indicating its use in structured eating patterns aimed at long-term weight stability.  \n\nIn summary, GIỮ_CÂN represents a comprehensive dietary strategy focused on maintaining a balanced weight through moderate energy, high carbohydrate intake, moderate protein and fat, and rich vitamin content. It is a flexible, inclusive category that supports both physical and metabolic health, making it a valuable tool in nutritional planning for individuals managing their weight.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 526, "prompt_tokens": 858, "total_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
