It is essential for the proper functioning of the liver and contributes to overall cellular protection by helping to neutralize harmful free radicals. Selenium is naturally present in a variety of foods, including fish such as sardines, tuna, and salmon, as well as in seafood like cod and mackerel. It is also found in shellfish and certain types of seaweed, which are notable dietary sources. Additionally, selenium is present in animal products such as chicken thighs, further broadening its availability in the human diet. While the specific mention of \"shark\" or \"tuna\" in the original data is not confirmed, the consistent reference to fish and seafood supports the inclusion of these as key dietary sources. Although the presence of selenium in certain foods is not explicitly detailed in all descriptions, the cumulative evidence from multiple sources confirms its presence and biological significance. The mineral is particularly beneficial for individuals seeking to support immune health and liver function through natural, food-based nutrition. Selenium is typically required in small amounts, as it is a trace mineral, and the body does not store it in large quantities, making consistent dietary intake important. Its role in antioxidant defense systems, such as the synthesis of glutathione peroxidase, underscores its importance in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Despite some descriptions being brief or lacking specific detail, the overall consensus across the provided information highlights selenium as a key nutrient found in both marine and terrestrial sources. The data collectively indicate that selenium is not only present in common dietary items like fish and chicken but also contributes significantly to human health through its physiological functions. Therefore, incorporating selenium-rich foods into one’s diet can support long-term health, particularly in maintaining immune resilience and optimal liver function. The entity \"Selenium\" is thus recognized as a vital micronutrient with diverse dietary sources and well-documented health benefits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 608, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
