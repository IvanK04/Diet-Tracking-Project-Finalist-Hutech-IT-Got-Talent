It plays a vital role in maintaining metabolic balance and overall health. Found in a wide variety of dietary sources, zinc is present in animal-based foods such as pork, pork chop, chicken wings, and fish fillets, as well as in plant-based foods including walnuts, peanuts, sesame oil, coconut oil, coconut, mango, and sunflower oil. It is also found in leafy greens like kale, spinach, and green cabbage, as well as in nuts, seeds, and certain vegetables such as garlic, cucumber, and tomato. Additional sources include amaranth, cinnamon, lemon, and galangal. Zinc contributes to immune system strength, supports tissue repair, and facilitates critical enzymatic reactions necessary for cellular processes. Its presence in both animal and plant-based foods makes it accessible across diverse diets. While some descriptions mention specific foods like brown sugar and peanut oil, the consistent theme across all sources is zinc’s critical role in immune function, wound healing, and metabolic health. Although minor discrepancies exist—such as the inclusion of fish fillets in a mineral list or references to \"minerals list\"—these do not contradict the core scientific understanding of zinc as a trace mineral involved in these biological functions. The information collectively confirms that zinc is widely distributed in common dietary items and is indispensable for maintaining immune resilience and cellular integrity. The mineral’s presence in both animal and plant sources ensures broad dietary availability, supporting its importance in global nutrition. Overall, zinc is a fundamental nutrient that supports health through its involvement in enzymatic activity, immune regulation, and tissue regeneration. Its presence in foods ranging from seafood and meats to nuts, oils, and vegetables underscores its role as a key component of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 563, "total_tokens": 935, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
