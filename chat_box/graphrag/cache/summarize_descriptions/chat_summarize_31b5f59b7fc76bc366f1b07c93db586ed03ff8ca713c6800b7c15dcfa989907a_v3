This benefit is notably observed in red chili peppers and ridge gourd, which contain significant amounts of vitamin C and vitamin B6. These nutrients play essential roles in supporting immune function by promoting the production of white blood cells, aiding in the repair of tissues, and helping to combat oxidative stress. Additionally, chicken livers and chicken guts are recognized for their high content of vital vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, folate, and iron, all of which contribute to robust immune function. Vitamin A supports the integrity of skin and mucosal barriers, which act as the first line of defense against pathogens, while folate and iron are crucial for the proper functioning and proliferation of immune cells. Together, these dietary sources provide a synergistic effect in strengthening the immune system through diverse nutritional pathways. Although the specific mechanisms may vary slightly between foods, the overall outcome is a significant enhancement of the body’s ability to respond to infections and maintain homeostasis. The presence of multiple bioactive compounds in both plant-based (red chili peppers, ridge gourd) and animal-based (chicken livers, chicken guts) sources underscores the importance of a varied diet in achieving optimal immune health. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; rather, they complement each other by illustrating how different food sources contribute to immune support through distinct but equally valuable nutrients. Thus, IMMUNE_SUPPORT is best understood as a multifaceted health benefit supported by a range of natural food sources, each offering unique nutritional advantages. This comprehensive approach highlights the value of incorporating diverse, nutrient-rich foods into daily diets to promote long-term immune resilience.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
