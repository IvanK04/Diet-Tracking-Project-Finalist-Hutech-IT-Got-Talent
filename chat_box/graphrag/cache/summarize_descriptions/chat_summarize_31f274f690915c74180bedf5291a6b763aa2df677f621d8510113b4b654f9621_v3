It plays a vital role in maintaining strong bones, supporting muscle function, and promoting overall development. Calcium is present in several dishes, including Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, where it supports bone and dental health; Nộm rau muống, where it contributes to bone and joint health; roasted peanuts, where it supports both bone health and muscle function; and soup powder, which is important for bone and teeth health. Notably, calcium content is particularly significant in Trạch tẩm bột chiên (294.4mg) and Tôm sốt cà chua (80mg), highlighting its presence in both moderate and higher amounts across different meals. While the descriptions emphasize calcium’s benefits for bone health, joint health, and general wellness, they consistently align in affirming its role as a foundational nutrient for skeletal integrity and bodily function. Although some descriptions mention specific dishes, the overarching theme is calcium’s consistent contribution to health across diverse culinary sources. There are no contradictory claims in the data; all descriptions reinforce calcium’s importance in supporting bone structure, joint mobility, dental health, and overall physiological well-being. The mineral is not only essential for structural support but also plays a role in nerve signaling and blood clotting, further underscoring its significance in human health. The presence of calcium in both plant-based and animal-based dishes—such as roasted peanuts and seafood-based meals—demonstrates its broad dietary availability. This widespread presence ensures that individuals can obtain adequate calcium through varied meals, supporting long-term health outcomes. In summary, calcium is a critical mineral found in multiple dishes, including Nộm rau muống, Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, roasted peanuts, soup powder, Trạch tẩm bột chiên, and Tôm sốt cà chua, all of which contribute to bone and joint health, dental integrity, and overall wellness. Its consistent presence across different food items makes it a key nutrient in balanced diets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 433, "prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 778, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
