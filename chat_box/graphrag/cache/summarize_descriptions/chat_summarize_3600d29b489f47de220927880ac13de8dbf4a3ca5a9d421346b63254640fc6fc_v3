These leaves are celebrated for their high fiber content and rich profile of essential minerals and vitamins, making them a valuable addition to a balanced diet. Per 100 grams, sweet potato leaves contain approximately 22 calories, 2.9 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and zero fat, positioning them as a low-calorie, high-fiber food ideal for those seeking healthy, satiating meals. They are particularly rich in key vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A and beta-carotene, which support vision and immune function; vitamin C, which promotes skin health and antioxidant activity; and a broad spectrum of B vitamins such as niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, and thiamin, which play vital roles in energy metabolism and nervous system function. Additionally, they provide significant amounts of calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, and manganese—nutrients essential for bone health, red blood cell formation, muscle function, and metabolic processes.\n\nThe nutritional composition of sweet potato leaves supports digestive health due to their high dietary fiber, which aids in regular bowel movements and promotes a healthy gut microbiome. Their mineral content, especially iron and calcium, contributes to overall wellness and helps prevent deficiencies common in plant-based diets. As a result, sweet potato leaves are well-suited for vegan and plant-based eating patterns, offering a natural, whole-food source of essential nutrients without the need for animal products. \n\nDespite some variations in reported nutrient values across sources, the consistent presence of vitamins A, C, and the B complex, along with minerals like magnesium, calcium, and iron, confirms their status as a highly nutritious food. While some descriptions emphasize their role in digestive health and general wellness, the detailed macronutrient and micronutrient profile reinforces their value as a low-calorie, nutrient-rich option. There are no contradictory claims in the provided data; all descriptions align in highlighting the health benefits, nutritional density, and culinary use of sweet potato leaves. \n\nIn summary, sweet potato leaves are a versatile, nutritious leafy green that supports digestive health, energy metabolism, and overall well-being. Their low caloric content, high fiber, and rich array of vitamins and minerals make them a sustainable and beneficial component of both traditional and modern diets. Whether incorporated into soups, stir-fries, or side dishes in Vietnamese cooking, sweet potato leaves offer a powerful, plant-based source of essential nutrients, contributing to a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Their suitability for vegan diets further enhances their appeal as a sustainable and accessible food choice in diverse culinary and dietary contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 545, "prompt_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 859, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
