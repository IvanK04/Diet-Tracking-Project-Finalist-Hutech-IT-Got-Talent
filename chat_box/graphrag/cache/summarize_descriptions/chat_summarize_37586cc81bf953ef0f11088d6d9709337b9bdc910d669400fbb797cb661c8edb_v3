It is prominently listed as a potential allergen in various food products, particularly in dishes and processed items that contain egg or egg-based ingredients. This allergenic property is especially relevant in baked goods and desserts, where egg components are frequently used to provide structure, texture, and richness. For instance, many traditional and commercial desserts—such as cakes, pastries, and custards—contain TRỨNG, making them potential sources of allergic exposure. As a result, individuals with egg allergies must carefully read food labels and avoid products that list egg or egg derivatives. The presence of TRỨNG in such foods underscores the importance of allergen awareness in both home cooking and food service environments. While TRỨNG is a natural component in many culinary preparations, its role as a common allergen necessitates caution, especially in children and those with known sensitivities. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all consistently identify TRỨNG as an allergen found in food items, particularly in desserts and other egg-containing dishes. The descriptions collectively emphasize its prevalence in common food products and its potential to provoke allergic responses. Therefore, TRỨNG remains a significant consideration in food safety and dietary management for allergic individuals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
