The dish primarily features wheat noodles, complemented by a range of ingredients including há cảo hấp (steamed water spinach), cải ngọt luộc (steamed sweet cabbage), trứng vịt luộc (boiled duck eggs), thịt lợn xá xíu (pork xá xíu), nấm hương chần (blanched wood ear mushrooms), and tôm biển luộc (steamed sea shrimp). Additional elements such as rau mùi (coriander), ớt đỏ (red chili), and a savory broth further enhance its taste and texture. The meal is nutritionally balanced, containing 384.1 calories, 20 grams of protein, 30.5 grams of carbohydrates, and 20.2 grams of fat, making it a substantial and energy-dense option suitable for those seeking a hearty, satisfying meal.  \n\nIn terms of nutritional profile, Mỳ vằn thắn is classified as a high-protein, high-carbohydrate meal, ideal for individuals aiming to gain weight or maintain energy levels throughout the day. It is also noted for its high content of vitamin A and iron, contributing to overall health and vitality. Despite being dairy-free, the dish includes several allergens, including eggs, shellfish (from the shrimp), pork, gluten (from the wheat noodles and potentially processed components), and mushrooms (wood ear). These allergens must be carefully considered by individuals with sensitivities or dietary restrictions.  \n\nThe dish is often described as a fusion of elements from different regional Vietnamese culinary traditions, combining the comforting texture of noodles with the savory depth of pork-based xá xíu and the freshness of steamed vegetables. While one description highlights the inclusion of pork liver and pork belly, which may contribute to higher fat and protein content, the more comprehensive version emphasizes a balanced array of ingredients that support both satiety and nutritional value. The presence of both pork and duck eggs aligns with the dish’s reputation as a rich, protein-dense meal, while the inclusion of vegetables ensures a good supply of vitamins and fiber.  \n\nAlthough there are slight variations in ingredient lists—such as the inclusion of pork liver and dumplings in one description and the absence of such items in another—these differences likely reflect regional or family-based preparations rather than fundamental contradictions. The core components—noodles, broth, vegetables, and protein sources—remain consistent, supporting the dish’s role as a staple in Vietnamese households.  \n\nIn summary, Mỳ vằn thắn is a nutritious, flavorful, and culturally significant meal that offers a well-rounded combination of proteins, carbohydrates, and essential vitamins. It is best enjoyed by those who can accommodate its allergens and appreciate its hearty, traditional character. With its balanced nutritional profile and diverse ingredients, Mỳ vằn thắn stands out as a beloved and versatile dish in Vietnamese cuisine.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 623, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 1019, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
