One of its most popular offerings is a chicken broth mix designed to enhance the flavor of soups, stews, and other chicken-based dishes. This product is formulated to deliver rich, savory taste, making it a convenient ingredient for home cooking and meal preparation. However, the broth mix contains high levels of sodium and carbohydrates, which may be a consideration for individuals monitoring their salt or sugar intake. Despite its flavor-enhancing benefits, consumers should be aware of the nutritional profile, as the high sodium content may contribute to health concerns when consumed in excess. The company’s focus on ready-to-use seasoning solutions aligns with the growing demand for convenient, flavorful food additives in modern kitchens. While the product is widely appreciated for its ability to elevate the taste of meals, its nutritional composition suggests that it should be used in moderation, especially by those with dietary restrictions or health conditions related to sodium sensitivity. Overall, KNORR plays a significant role in the ready-to-use seasoning market, offering accessible and flavorful options that support everyday cooking needs. The brand’s consistency in product quality and flavor delivery has established it as a trusted name in the food seasoning industry.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 470, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
