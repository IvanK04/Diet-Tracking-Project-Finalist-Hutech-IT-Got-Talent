It is widely recognized for its high nutritional value, containing significantly more vitamin C than oranges of the same size, making it a valuable source of this essential nutrient. In addition to vitamin C, kiwi contains actinidin, a natural enzyme that aids in the digestion of proteins, contributing to improved gastrointestinal health. The fruit's fuzzy outer skin is not only edible but also adds valuable dietary fiber and additional nutrients, enhancing its overall nutritional profile. While many consumers traditionally peel kiwi to avoid the fuzzy texture, this practice is unnecessary, as the skin is safe to eat and offers health benefits. The tangy-sweet flavor of kiwi makes it a popular choice in a variety of culinary applications, including fresh consumption, fruit salads, smoothies, and desserts. Its unique combination of texture, flavor, and nutritional content has established kiwi as a globally appreciated fruit, particularly in regions where it is cultivated such as New Zealand, where it is both a cultural symbol and a major agricultural product. Despite its small size, kiwi provides a substantial amount of health-promoting compounds, including antioxidants and dietary fiber, which support immune function and digestive wellness. The fruit's natural enzyme, actinidin, has also been studied for its potential benefits in improving protein breakdown, which may aid in overall nutrient absorption. Overall, kiwi stands out as a nutrient-dense, flavorful, and health-supportive fruit that offers both culinary versatility and significant health advantages when consumed in its whole form. Its popularity continues to grow due to its balanced nutritional composition and the growing awareness of the benefits of consuming the edible skin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 718, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
