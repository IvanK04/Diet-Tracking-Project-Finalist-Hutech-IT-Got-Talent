It plays a key role in giving dough its elasticity and structure, making it essential in many baked goods. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger adverse immune responses, leading to inflammation and damage to the small intestine. As such, gluten is classified as a significant allergen in dietary contexts. While gluten is absent in certain foods like cobia and bamboo shoots, its presence in specific ingredients such as bahn quay indicates that not all foods are inherently gluten-free. This inconsistency highlights the importance of checking food labels and ingredient lists, as even seemingly simple foods may contain gluten. Notably, tapioca flour is naturally free of gluten, making it a suitable alternative for those following a gluten-free diet. In contrast, the presence of gluten in bahn quay suggests that some traditional or regional dishes may contain gluten, rendering them unsuitable for individuals with gluten-related disorders. This presents a challenge in dietary management, as cross-contamination or hidden sources of gluten can occur even in products labeled as gluten-free. Therefore, while gluten is absent in certain plant-based foods and starches, its presence in specific culinary items underscores the need for careful labeling and awareness. The variability in gluten content across different foods emphasizes that gluten-free diets require vigilance and informed choices. In summary, GLUTEN is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, acting as a common allergen for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. It is absent in foods such as cobia and bamboo shoots and in gluten-free flours like tapioca, but may be present in dishes like bahn quay. This duality means that while some foods are inherently gluten-free, others—especially traditional or processed items—may contain gluten, necessitating careful dietary planning and label reading to ensure safety and health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 604, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
