It plays a central role in dishes such as háo cảo hấp, where it is incorporated as a key component to provide richness and depth of taste. In another popular dish, Goi ngó sen, pork is sliced thinly and carefully cooked to enhance both its flavor and texture, resulting in a dish that is not only satisfying but also high in protein and energy. These culinary applications highlight pork’s adaptability and its importance in delivering both gustatory appeal and nutritional benefits. The preparation methods—such as thin slicing and controlled cooking—demonstrate a focus on preserving the meat’s natural qualities while optimizing its contribution to the overall dish. Overall, THỊT HEO serves as a foundational element in several Vietnamese side dishes, valued for its ability to complement other ingredients and elevate the sensory experience of the meal. Its use in both háo cảo hấp and Goi ngó sen underscores its consistent presence across different regional and cultural variations of Vietnamese food. Despite the differences in preparation, the common thread is pork’s role in enhancing flavor, texture, and nutritional content. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions, as both highlight pork’s use in distinct but related dishes with consistent culinary purposes. The information collectively supports the idea that THỊT HEO is not only a staple ingredient but also a key contributor to the balance of taste, texture, and nutrition in traditional Vietnamese meals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
