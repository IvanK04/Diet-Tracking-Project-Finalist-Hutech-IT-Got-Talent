It plays a critical role in supporting nerve function and maintaining heart health. Thiamin is widely distributed in various food sources, including bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, sunflower seeds, carp, bean sprouts, chicken livers, and sticky rice. These dietary sources contribute to the body’s ability to convert carbohydrates into usable energy, making thiamin a vital nutrient for overall metabolic function. Its involvement in nervous system function underscores its importance in maintaining proper neurological activity and cognitive health. While thiamin is primarily recognized for its role in energy production, it also supports cardiovascular function and the integrity of the nervous system. The presence of thiamin in diverse plant and animal-based foods highlights its broad dietary availability and nutritional significance. Despite minor variations in the specific food sources mentioned across descriptions, all point to a consistent role in energy metabolism and nerve function. There are no contradictory claims regarding thiamin’s functions or sources; rather, the descriptions collectively reinforce its essential biological roles and wide range of dietary sources. Therefore, thiamin stands out as a fundamental nutrient in human nutrition, supporting both metabolic and neurological health through its presence in a variety of commonly consumed foods.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
