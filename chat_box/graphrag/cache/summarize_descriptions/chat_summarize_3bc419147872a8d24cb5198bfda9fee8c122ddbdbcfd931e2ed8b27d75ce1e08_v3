It plays a central role in energy production by participating in cellular respiration and the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into usable energy. Additionally, riboflavin is critical for the formation and function of red blood cells, supporting healthy hematopoiesis and oxygen transport throughout the body. Its involvement in cellular function extends to maintaining metabolic health, including the proper functioning of the nervous system and skin integrity.\n\nRiboflavin is widely distributed across a diverse range of dietary sources. It is found in animal-based foods such as pork chop, chicken breast, fish, chicken wings, and eggs, as well as in plant-based foods including green peas, mushrooms, garlic, cucumber, tomato, kale, leafy greens, green cabbage, edamame, and citrus fruits. Notably, it is also present in spices like cinnamon and lemon, highlighting its broad availability in both staple and culinary foods. These dietary sources ensure that individuals can obtain riboflavin through a variety of meals, supporting balanced nutrition.\n\nThe consistent theme across all descriptions is riboflavin’s fundamental role in energy metabolism and red blood cell formation. While some descriptions emphasize its function in cellular function and metabolic health, others specifically link it to red blood cell production, which is a key physiological outcome of its activity. There are no contradictory claims regarding riboflavin’s functions or sources; rather, the descriptions converge on a unified picture of its importance in energy conversion and cellular health. The minor variations in food examples—such as grouper, amaranth, or pork chop—do not introduce conflict but instead illustrate the vitamin’s wide dietary distribution.\n\nIn summary, riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a vital nutrient involved in energy production, red blood cell formation, and cellular function. It is naturally present in a broad spectrum of foods, including meats, fish, leafy greens, legumes, and various vegetables and fruits. Its presence in both animal and plant-based diets makes it accessible to diverse populations. By supporting metabolic processes and maintaining healthy blood cells, riboflavin contributes significantly to overall physiological well-being. Its role in energy metabolism and cellular health underscores its importance in daily nutrition and long-term health outcomes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 472, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 928, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
