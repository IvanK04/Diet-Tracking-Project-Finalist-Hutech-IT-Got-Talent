It plays a central role in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a critical molecule involved in fatty acid metabolism, energy production, and hormone synthesis. Pantothenic acid is vital for energy metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and the production of key hormones, making it indispensable for maintaining normal physiological functions. It is widely distributed across a broad range of dietary sources, including animal products such as whole chicken, eggs, fish, and scallops, as well as plant-based foods like peas, onions, corn, red cabbage, peanuts, and whole grains. Specific food items noted for containing pantothenic acid include fried chicken style northeast, egg noodles, bưởi chùm, ngò tây, and cải bó xôi (red cabbage). The vitamin is particularly important in supporting metabolic pathways related to energy generation and the biosynthesis of coenzymes, which are fundamental to cellular function. While it is commonly found in both animal and plant-based foods, its presence is especially prominent in meat, eggs, and whole grains. Despite some variations in the specific food examples provided—such as the mention of bưởi chùm and ngò tây, which are Vietnamese herbs—these reflect the broad dietary availability of pantothenic acid. All descriptions converge on the core functions of pantothenic acid in coenzyme A synthesis and metabolic regulation, with consistent references to its role in energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and hormone production. The data collectively affirm that pantothenic acid is a ubiquitous and essential nutrient, found in diverse food sources and playing a foundational role in human metabolism.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 536, "total_tokens": 884, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
