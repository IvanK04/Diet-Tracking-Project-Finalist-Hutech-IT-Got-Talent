It is rich in protein, dietary fiber, and essential nutrients such as isoflavones, folate, and choline, making it a nutritious and health-promoting ingredient. Soybean is a cornerstone of plant-based diets and is considered vegan-friendly due to its high protein content and absence of animal-derived components. It serves as a foundational ingredient in a variety of food products, including edamame, soy milk, tofu, tempeh, and other soy-based goods. The legume's nutritional profile supports both general health and specific dietary needs, such as those related to heart health, hormonal balance, and sustainable eating. Its versatility allows it to be consumed in both raw and processed forms, including whole soybeans, soy flour, and fermented products. As a globally cultivated crop, soybean plays a significant role in food security and the development of plant-based alternatives to animal products. Its use spans culinary traditions across Asia, North America, and Europe, reflecting its adaptability and cultural significance. While some concerns have been raised about the processing methods and potential allergenicity, the overall scientific consensus supports soybean as a safe and beneficial component of a balanced diet when consumed in moderation. The presence of isoflavones—phytoestrogens with potential health benefits—has led to ongoing research into their role in reducing risk factors for certain chronic diseases. Despite these benefits, individuals with soy allergies should avoid it. Overall, soybean stands out as a nutrient-dense, sustainable, and widely accessible food source that contributes significantly to modern plant-based nutrition. Its integration into diverse food systems underscores its importance in both traditional and contemporary dietary practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 617, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
