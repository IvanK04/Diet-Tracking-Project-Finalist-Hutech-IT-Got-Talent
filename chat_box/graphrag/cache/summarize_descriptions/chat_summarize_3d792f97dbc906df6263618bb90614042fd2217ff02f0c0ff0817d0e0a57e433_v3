It is naturally found in a variety of plant-based foods, including kale, cai xoong, pickled mustard greens, and carrots. These dietary sources contribute to the overall nutritional value of the foods and support key physiological functions such as proper blood coagulation and the maintenance of strong, healthy bones. While the primary roles of Vitamin K are well established—particularly in facilitating blood clotting and promoting bone mineralization—some descriptions also suggest a broader contribution to overall health, including immune function. However, this role is less directly supported by current scientific consensus and may be an extension of its involvement in cellular processes rather than a primary function. The presence of Vitamin K in leafy greens like kale and cai xoong, as well as in fermented or preserved vegetables such as pickled mustard greens, highlights its widespread availability in both fresh and processed plant foods. Carrots, while containing small amounts of Vitamin K, are not a primary source compared to leafy greens. Despite minor variations in the specific food sources mentioned, the core functions of Vitamin K remain consistent across all descriptions. The nutrient is part of a broader group of vitamins that play critical roles in metabolic and physiological balance, though its most significant and well-documented benefits are in blood clotting and bone health. Any suggestion of a direct role in immune function should be interpreted with caution and viewed as a potential indirect benefit rather than a primary action. Overall, Vitamin K is a crucial micronutrient that supports essential bodily functions, particularly in maintaining healthy blood and bones, and is widely available in common dietary sources. Its importance in human nutrition is underscored by its presence in diverse plant foods, making it accessible through a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
