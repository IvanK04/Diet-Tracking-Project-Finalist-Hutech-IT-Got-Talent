This characteristic makes certain food items suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, as consuming gluten can trigger adverse health reactions in such individuals. The attribute is specifically noted in foods such as pork ears and Vietnamese coriander, which are naturally free of gluten due to their biological composition. Additionally, both thunh long and durian are confirmed to contain no gluten, further supporting their classification as gluten-free. This absence of gluten ensures that these foods are safe for consumption by those with gluten-related disorders. The consistency across multiple food items—such as pork ears, Vietnamese coriander, thunh long, and durian—demonstrates that the gluten-free status is not only a property of specific ingredients but also a reliable feature of these particular foods. While some may assume that certain regional or processed foods inherently contain gluten, in this case, the natural origin of these items contributes to their safe profile. The presence of gluten-free options among these foods provides valuable dietary flexibility, especially in diverse culinary settings where individuals with dietary restrictions are present. It is important to note that while the term \"gluten-free\" is often associated with processed or labeled products, in this context, it applies to naturally occurring foods that do not contain gluten proteins. This reinforces the idea that some traditional or regional foods can be inherently safe for gluten-sensitive individuals. The data collectively confirms that GLUTEN-FREE is a valid and consistent dietary attribute for pork ears, Vietnamese coriander, thunh long, and durian. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions, as all sources align in identifying these foods as naturally free of gluten. Therefore, the summary affirms that these items are safe and suitable for consumption by individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. This makes GLUTEN-FREE a reliable and beneficial attribute in both dietary planning and food labeling.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 404, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 608, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
