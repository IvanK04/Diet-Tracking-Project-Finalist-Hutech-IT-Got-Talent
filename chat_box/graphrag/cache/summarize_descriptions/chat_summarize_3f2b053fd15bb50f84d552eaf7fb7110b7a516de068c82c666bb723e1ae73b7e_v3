It is essential for energy metabolism, supporting the conversion of food into usable energy through the production of coenzyme A (CoA), a key molecule in cellular respiration. Additionally, Vitamin B5 contributes to the proper functioning of the nervous system by aiding in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, which are critical for communication between nerve cells. It also participates in blood formation by supporting the production of red blood cells and maintaining healthy hematopoietic function. Found naturally in a variety of foods, Vitamin B5 is particularly present in sticky rice, making it a dietary source for individuals who consume this staple food. Its widespread presence in both plant and animal-based foods ensures that it is generally accessible in the diet. Overall, Vitamin B5 is a fundamental nutrient that supports metabolic health, neurological function, and the integrity of the circulatory system. Its role in multiple biochemical pathways underscores its importance in maintaining overall well-being.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
