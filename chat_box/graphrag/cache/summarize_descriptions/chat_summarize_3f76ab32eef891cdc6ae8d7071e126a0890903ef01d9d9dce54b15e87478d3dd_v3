It plays a critical role in skeletal strength, muscle contraction, and overall physiological function. Found in a wide variety of foods, calcium is present in black beans and almonds, leafy greens, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, salmon, chicken livers, catfish fillet, dairy products, chè thái, cháo gà, sticky rice, tamarind sauce, wonton noodles, pears, mangosteen, tomatoes, and fish. In specific dishes, calcium content varies: cháo gà contains 129.8mg per serving, while a serving of a dish with fish provides 96mg, and another contains 141.6mg, all contributing to bone and joint health. In Vietnamese cuisine, leafy greens are particularly noted for their high calcium content and benefits to digestive and overall health. Although some descriptions mention calcium in fruits like pears and mangosteen, these sources are likely minor contributors compared to more significant dietary sources. The presence of calcium in both plant-based and animal-based foods underscores its broad dietary availability. Despite minor inconsistencies in food sources—such as the inclusion of sticky rice or fish in calcium content—these are consistent with the mineral’s widespread presence in diverse diets. The descriptions collectively affirm calcium’s importance in supporting strong bones, teeth, muscle function, and nerve signaling. While some sources list calcium in non-traditional foods like sticky rice or pear, these are likely due to trace amounts or regional dietary practices. Overall, calcium remains a fundamental nutrient, widely distributed across global cuisines and food groups, with significant contributions from both traditional and modern dietary sources. Its role in maintaining structural and functional integrity of the body makes it indispensable in human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 614, "total_tokens": 993, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
