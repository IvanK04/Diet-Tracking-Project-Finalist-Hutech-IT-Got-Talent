It is found in a wide range of food sources, including animal-based products such as beef, chicken livers, chicken drumsticks, pork ears, and organ meats, as well as in plant-based alternatives. In specific dishes, protein content varies significantly: Cá thu rán sốt cà chua provides a high amount of 45.8g of protein per serving, making it exceptionally effective for muscle growth and recovery. Other dishes such as Cai chi p xao nham contain 14.3g of protein per serving, while Muc xao thap cam offers 11.3g, both contributing to muscle development and overall health. Chicken drumsticks and chicken livers are noted for their high protein content and essential amino acid profile, supporting muscle repair and bodily functions. Additionally, a serving of a particular dish contains 13.9g of protein, aiding in muscle repair and energy recovery, while another provides a substantial 22.1g per serving, supporting muscle development, recovery, and general well-being. Protein is also found in Vietnamese coriander, though its primary role is as a macronutrient in various animal and plant-based foods. Across all sources, protein is consistently recognized as a fundamental nutrient for maintaining muscle mass, promoting tissue regeneration, and supporting metabolic and physiological processes. While some descriptions mention pork ears and coriander, the primary emphasis remains on protein’s role in muscle repair and health, with the highest protein content observed in Cá thu rán sốt cà chua. Despite minor discrepancies in specific food sources or protein amounts, the overarching theme remains consistent: protein is indispensable for human health, muscle development, and recovery, and is widely distributed across diverse dietary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 391, "prompt_tokens": 479, "total_tokens": 870, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
