It is rich in high-quality protein, containing 18.5% protein and 8.55% fat, with no carbohydrates, making it a low-carb, nutrient-dense food option. This cut is particularly valued for its lean composition and nutritional profile, which includes a variety of B vitamins and essential minerals such as zinc, selenium, and phosphorus. These nutrients support energy metabolism, immune function, and overall cellular health. However, due to the presence of potentially harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli, pork chop, when consumed raw, poses a food safety risk. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that pork chop be thoroughly cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145°F (63°C) to ensure safety and eliminate pathogens. While raw pork chop is occasionally used in specific culinary traditions or in certain raw food diets, such consumption is not advised due to health risks. The combination of its high protein content and essential micronutrients makes cooked pork chop a nutritious component of a balanced diet when prepared properly. Its versatility allows it to be prepared in numerous ways—such as pan-seared, baked, or grilled—enhancing flavor and texture while preserving its nutritional benefits. Despite its lean nature, the 8.55% fat content contributes to the meat’s flavor and helps support healthy lipid function in the body. Overall, pork chop remains a popular and nutritious meat choice when handled and prepared with proper food safety practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
