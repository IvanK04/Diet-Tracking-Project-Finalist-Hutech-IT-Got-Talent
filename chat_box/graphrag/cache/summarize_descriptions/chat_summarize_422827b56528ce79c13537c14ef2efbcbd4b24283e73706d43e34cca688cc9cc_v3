It plays a critical role in the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, supporting overall metabolic health. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining healthy skin and eye function, contributing to the integrity of these vital systems. The vitamin is widely distributed across various food sources, including bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, chicken livers, sunflower seeds, carp, and sticky rice. It is also found in dark-colored legumes such as black beans and in nuts like almonds and sunflower seeds. Additionally, riboflavin is present in chicken livers, where it supports energy metabolism and cellular processes. The presence of riboflavin in diverse plant and animal-based foods underscores its broad dietary availability and importance in human nutrition. While some descriptions mention specific regional or linguistic references—such as \"RIBOFLAVIN là một vitamin B, có mặt trong dồi huyết và hạt vừng đen, hỗ trợ chuyển hóa năng lượng và duy trì sức khỏe da và mắt\"—these are consistent with the broader role of riboflavin in energy metabolism and skin and eye health. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all align with riboflavin’s well-established functions in energy production, cellular metabolism, and tissue health. The vitamin is recognized in nutritional metadata as a key contributor to metabolic function and overall well-being. Its presence across a wide range of foods, from plant-based sources like bean sprouts and sticky rice to animal-based sources such as chicken livers and fish, highlights its accessibility and nutritional significance. Riboflavin’s role in supporting energy conversion and cellular processes makes it a fundamental component of a balanced diet. In summary, riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a vital nutrient found in numerous foods, essential for energy metabolism, cellular function, and the maintenance of healthy skin and eyes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 420, "total_tokens": 827, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
