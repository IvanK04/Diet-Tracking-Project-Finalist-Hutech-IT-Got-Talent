It supports metabolic functions, including the breakdown of sugars and fats, and contributes to the body’s defense against oxidative stress through its involvement in antioxidant systems. Found in a wide variety of foods, manganese is particularly abundant in leafy greens such as kale and spinach, as well as in vegetables like cucumber, tomato, green cabbage, and celery. It is also present in fruits such as mango and coconut, and in plant-based foods including amaranth, oats, rice, and beans. Animal sources include fish, squid, grouper, pork liver, and chicken wings. Additionally, manganese is found in nuts, whole grains, avocados, garlic, mushrooms, green peas, and even in less conventional sources like brown sugar and sunflower oil. Its presence in these diverse foods underscores its widespread availability in the diet and its importance in maintaining skeletal health and metabolic balance. While the mineral is not a primary source of energy, it acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, enabling key biochemical processes. The consistent emphasis across descriptions on manganese’s role in bone formation, metabolic regulation, and antioxidant defense highlights its fundamental contribution to overall health. Although some descriptions mention specific food sources with slight variations, there is no contradiction in the core functions or dietary sources attributed to manganese. All references converge on its importance in metabolic and skeletal health, with no conflicting claims about its biological roles. The mineral’s presence in both plant and animal-based foods ensures broad dietary accessibility, making it a vital component of a balanced diet. Manganese’s involvement in enzymatic reactions related to carbohydrate and fat metabolism, along with its support of bone mineralization, positions it as a key micronutrient in human nutrition. Despite being required in small amounts, its deficiency can impair bone development and metabolic efficiency, while adequate intake supports long-term health and disease prevention. Thus, manganese is a versatile and essential trace mineral, integral to multiple physiological processes and widely distributed across the food supply.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 419, "prompt_tokens": 608, "total_tokens": 1027, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
