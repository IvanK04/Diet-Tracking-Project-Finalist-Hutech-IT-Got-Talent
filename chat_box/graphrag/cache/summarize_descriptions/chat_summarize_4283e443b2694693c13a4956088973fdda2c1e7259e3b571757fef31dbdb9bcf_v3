This attribute is present in both cà phê trứng and other protein-rich meals, highlighting its role in supporting muscle maintenance and overall nutritional value. Additionally, GIÀU_PROTEIN is also observed in Tôm đông lạnh (frozen shrimp) and Cá ngừ vây vàng sống (fresh yellowfin tuna), further emphasizing its presence across diverse food categories. These items are recognized for their significant protein content, making them valuable components in balanced diets. The consistency of this attribute across different food types—ranging from traditional beverages like cà phê trứng to seafood such as frozen shrimp and fresh yellowfin tuna—demonstrates its broad applicability in nutritional contexts. While the specific protein levels may vary between dishes, the presence of high protein content is a shared characteristic that contributes to the health benefits associated with these foods. This attribute is not limited to a single cuisine or preparation method, suggesting that GIÀU_PROTEIN is a reliable indicator of nutritional quality across both processed and fresh food items. The inclusion of both animal-based sources (such as shrimp and tuna) and a traditional beverage (cà phê trứng) underscores the versatility of high-protein foods in daily consumption. Despite potential differences in protein sources and preparation, all listed items share the common trait of being rich in protein, which supports bodily functions such as tissue repair, immune function, and satiety. Therefore, GIÀU_PROTEIN serves as a key nutritional marker for consumers seeking protein-dense options. The attribute is not only relevant in dietary planning but also in health education, where it helps identify foods that contribute to a well-rounded, protein-sufficient diet. In summary, GIÀU_PROTEIN is a consistent and significant health attribute found across a range of foods, including cà phê trứng, Tôm đông lạnh, and Cá ngừ vây vàng sống, reflecting its importance in promoting nutritional balance and supporting overall well-being.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 600, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
