Found in various foods, potassium contributes significantly to fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle activity, helping to regulate blood pressure and support overall health. In Goi xoai, potassium content is reported at 189 mg, where it aids in electrolyte balance and supports vital functions such as nerve and muscle activity. Meanwhile, gan xào giá contains a higher concentration of potassium at 1156 mg, further emphasizing the mineral’s importance in sustaining bodily functions including fluid regulation and muscle performance. While the potassium levels differ between these two dishes—Goi xoai with 189 mg and gan xào giá with 1156 mg—the consistent role of potassium across both foods underscores its fundamental contribution to human physiology. The variation in concentration may reflect differences in preparation, ingredients, or natural composition of the dishes. Despite the discrepancy in amounts, both sources highlight potassium’s essential function in maintaining homeostasis, particularly in regulating blood pressure and enabling proper nerve and muscle signaling. Therefore, Kali (potassium) serves as a key electrolyte in both Goi xoai and gan xào giá, supporting metabolic processes and overall well-being. The presence of potassium in these dishes suggests that dietary inclusion of such foods can contribute to a balanced intake of essential minerals. However, it is important to note that while potassium is beneficial, excessive intake—especially from concentrated sources—may pose risks for individuals with kidney issues or those on specific medical regimens. Thus, while Kali is vital for health, moderation and dietary context are crucial. In summary, potassium in both Goi xoai and gan xào giá supports electrolyte balance, nerve transmission, and muscle function, demonstrating its significance in daily nutrition. The differing levels reflect natural variation in food composition, but the physiological role of potassium remains consistent across these culinary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
