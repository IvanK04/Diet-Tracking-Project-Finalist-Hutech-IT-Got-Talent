It is crucial for overall cardiovascular and muscular health, contributing to the body’s ability to maintain homeostasis. Found in a wide variety of foods, potassium is present in both plant-based and animal-based sources. These include fruits such as mango and citrus, vegetables like green cabbage, cucumber, tomato, celery, green peas, and mushrooms, as well as legumes and whole grains such as long grain white rice and brown sugar. It is also present in animal products including chicken wings, pork, fish fillets, and eggs, as well as in plant-based items such as garlic, galangal, amaranth, kale, cinnamon, lemon, and baby corn. Additionally, potassium is found in foods like coconut, squid, grouper, and sunflower oil, though its role in the latter two is less prominent and may be contextually limited. While potassium is widely recognized for its role in fluid balance and blood pressure regulation, it also supports nerve function and muscle activity, making it indispensable for daily physiological processes. The mineral is particularly important in maintaining proper heart function and preventing conditions related to electrolyte imbalance. Although some descriptions mention potassium in foods like sunflower oil and brown sugar, these associations are likely due to trace or minor content and do not represent primary sources. All descriptions converge on potassium’s fundamental functions in fluid regulation, blood pressure control, and muscle and nerve activity. The consistency across multiple food sources—ranging from vegetables and fruits to meats and herbs—demonstrates its broad dietary presence and biological significance. Contradictions in the specific food sources (e.g., sunflower oil or brown sugar) are resolved by recognizing that while these items may contain trace amounts, the primary and most significant sources are vegetables, fruits, fish, and legumes. Therefore, potassium is best understood as a universally important mineral, essential for human health, with a diverse and well-documented presence across a wide range of commonly consumed foods. Its role in supporting cardiovascular, muscular, and neurological functions underscores its status as a fundamental nutrient in human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 455, "prompt_tokens": 561, "total_tokens": 1016, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
