It plays a central role in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and brain development and function. Additionally, Vitamin B6 supports immune function and contributes to overall metabolic health. Found in a wide variety of foods, it is present in animal sources such as whole chicken, pork, fish, beef sausage, and scallops, as well as plant-based sources including red chili peppers, red cabbage, peas, onions, whole grains, bananas, tofu, egg noodles, fried chicken style northeast, peanuts, peanut butter, and certain herbs like bưởi chùm and ngò tây. It is also detected in vegetables such as cải bó xôi (Chinese mustard greens) and in fruits like strawberries. The vitamin is particularly important for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, which are critical for neurological and cognitive processes. Its presence in diverse dietary sources underscores its broad nutritional significance. While some descriptions mention specific food items with limited context, the consistent theme across all references is Vitamin B6’s involvement in metabolic and neurological functions. Contradictions in food sources—such as strawberries being listed as a source while others do not—were resolved by noting that while strawberries may contain trace amounts, the primary dietary sources are more reliably established. The comprehensive list of foods reflects a broad dietary range, emphasizing that Vitamin B6 is accessible through both animal and plant-based meals. Overall, Vitamin B6 is a vital nutrient supporting brain health, immune function, and metabolic processes, and its presence in common foods makes it a key component of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 511, "total_tokens": 844, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
