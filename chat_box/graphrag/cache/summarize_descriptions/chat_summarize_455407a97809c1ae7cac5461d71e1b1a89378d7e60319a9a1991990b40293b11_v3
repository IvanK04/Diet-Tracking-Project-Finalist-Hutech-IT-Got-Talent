It plays a key role in supporting neurological function, metabolic processes, and overall cellular health. Found in a wide variety of foods, choline is present in whole chicken, eggs, chicken breast, sea bass, soybeans, tofu, legumes, vegetables such as ridge gourd, and even strawberries. It is also detected in corn, scallops, and ngò rí, demonstrating its broad dietary availability. Choline is consistently recognized in nutritional profiles across multiple food sources, reinforcing its importance in human health. While its presence in egg noodles is noted, the primary sources emphasized include animal-based proteins like chicken and seafood, as well as plant-based options such as soybeans and legumes. The nutrient supports both brain health and liver function, contributing to cognitive performance and metabolic regulation. Its presence in diverse food groups—ranging from animal products to vegetables and grains—highlights its versatility and accessibility in the diet. Although some descriptions mention specific foods with minor emphasis, there is no contradiction in the core functions or sources of choline. All descriptions converge on the same fundamental roles: brain function, liver health, and cell membrane structure. The nutrient is considered beneficial for overall health and is integral to neurological and metabolic well-being. Choline's widespread occurrence across both plant and animal-based foods ensures that it can be obtained through a varied and balanced diet. This comprehensive presence underscores its significance as a key micronutrient in human nutrition. Choline is not only essential for physiological processes but also serves as a foundational component in maintaining optimal brain and liver function. Its inclusion in nutritional assessments of various foods further validates its role in promoting general health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 399, "total_tokens": 750, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
