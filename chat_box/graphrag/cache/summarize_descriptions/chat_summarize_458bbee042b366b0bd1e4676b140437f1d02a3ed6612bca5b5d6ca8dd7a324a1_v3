It plays a key role in metabolic processes, supporting overall dermatological wellness and cellular function. Biotin is naturally present in a variety of plant-based foods, including cucumber, green peas, mushrooms, and tomato. Additionally, it is found in galangal, a spice commonly used in certain culinary traditions. These dietary sources contribute to the body’s biotin levels, helping to sustain the health of skin, hair, and nails while also supporting metabolic activity. The consistent emphasis across multiple sources on biotin’s benefits for skin, hair, and nail health, as well as its metabolic functions, underscores its importance in human nutrition. While the specific food sources vary slightly—such as cucumber, green peas, mushrooms, tomato, and galangal—each of these foods serves as a reliable natural source of biotin. The inclusion of both vegetables and spices highlights the broad dietary availability of this vitamin. Although some descriptions mention only a few food sources, the overall pattern confirms that biotin is widely distributed in common dietary items, making it accessible through a balanced diet. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all align in affirming biotin’s role in promoting skin, hair, and nail health and its contribution to metabolic wellness. The minor variation in listed foods does not undermine the core message but rather enriches the understanding of biotin’s dietary sources. Therefore, biotin stands out as a vital nutrient that supports both external appearance and internal metabolic health. Its presence in everyday foods like cucumbers, green peas, mushrooms, tomatoes, and galangal ensures that individuals can obtain adequate levels through natural, plant-based consumption. This widespread availability makes biotin a key component in nutritional strategies aimed at improving dermatological and overall well-being. In summary, biotin is a versatile and essential B-vitamin that contributes significantly to the health of skin, hair, and nails, while also supporting metabolic functions. Its presence in a diverse range of foods ensures that it is accessible to a broad population, reinforcing its importance in both general nutrition and targeted health support.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 454, "prompt_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 716, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
