It plays a critical role in enzyme function, metabolic processes, and the maintenance of metabolic health. Manganese is found in a diverse array of both animal and plant-based foods, including fish such as sea bass and scallops, meats like beef, pork mince, and chicken breast, as well as plant-based sources such as soybeans, legumes, parsnips, chili peppers, red pepper flakes, mushrooms, shallots, turnip greens, glass noodles, red cabbage, artichokes, tapioca flour, Vietnamese balm (ngò rí), ngò tây, ridge gourd, and strawberries. It is particularly important for supporting bone development and metabolic functions, including the breakdown of carbohydrates and amino acids. Manganese also contributes to antioxidant defense systems, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage. While it is present in various vegetables and grains, its concentration varies across food sources. Although some descriptions mention its presence in specific items like sò điệp (scallops) and cải bó xôi (turnip greens), the general consensus across all sources confirms its broad dietary availability and multifaceted biological roles. Despite minor inconsistencies in phrasing or specific food listings, all descriptions converge on manganese’s key functions in bone health, metabolism, and antioxidant activity. The mineral is recognized in nutritional databases and is considered vital for overall metabolic and enzymatic function. Its presence in both animal and plant-based foods ensures accessibility across different dietary patterns. Manganese is not only essential for metabolic processes but also supports enzymatic reactions critical to cellular function. Though some references note its inclusion in mineral lists without specific food details, the consistent emphasis on its role in bone formation and metabolic health underscores its importance in human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 750, "total_tokens": 1126, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
