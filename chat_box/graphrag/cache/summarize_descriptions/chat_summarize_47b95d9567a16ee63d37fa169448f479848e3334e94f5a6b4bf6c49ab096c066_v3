It plays a critical role in maintaining proper blood coagulation and supporting bone health by facilitating the synthesis of proteins involved in bone mineralization. Vitamin K is widely distributed across various food sources, including leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, and cải bó xôi (a type of Chinese cabbage), as well as fermented foods. It is also found in legumes, tofu, peanut butter, and certain plant-based foods like strawberries and ngò tây (a type of cilantro or parsley). Additionally, it is present in corn, contributing to metabolic functions. While some descriptions mention specific foods such as peanut butter and tofu, the consistent theme across all sources is that Vitamin K is vital for both blood clotting and bone health. The presence of Vitamin K in diverse dietary sources—ranging from plant-based options like leafy greens and legumes to animal-based products—highlights its broad availability and importance in human nutrition. Although some descriptions list strawberries and corn as sources, the primary and most reliable sources remain leafy greens and fermented foods. The inclusion of both animal and plant-based foods in the dietary profile of Vitamin K reflects its versatility across different diets. All provided descriptions converge on the core functions of Vitamin K in blood clotting and bone metabolism, with minor variations in specific food examples that do not contradict the central scientific consensus. These variations may reflect regional dietary practices or specific forms of Vitamin K (such as K1 in plants and K2 in fermented foods), but they do not undermine the overall role of the vitamin. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of Vitamin K emphasizes its essential biological functions and its presence in a wide array of commonly consumed foods, particularly those rich in green vegetables and fermented products. This makes Vitamin K a crucial nutrient for maintaining cardiovascular and skeletal health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 378, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 708, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
