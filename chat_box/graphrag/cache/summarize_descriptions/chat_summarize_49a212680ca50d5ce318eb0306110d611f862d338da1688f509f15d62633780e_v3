It plays a central role in maintaining skeletal health, supporting metabolic processes, and ensuring proper structure and function of cell membranes. Found across a wide range of dietary sources, phosphorus is present in animal-based products such as pork, fish fillets, chicken wings, and dairy, as well as in plant-based foods including leafy greens like kale, spinach, and green cabbage, and in various grains and legumes such as amaranth, rice, and peanuts. Specific food sources include squid, grouper, green peas, mushrooms, celery, garlic, cucumber, tomatoes, lemon, cinnamon, walnuts, peanut oil, sunflower oil, brown sugar, coconut, mango, and eggs. Its presence in these diverse foods underscores its widespread availability and importance in human nutrition. Phosphorus contributes to energy transfer and metabolism, particularly through its role in ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of cells. It is also critical for the structural integrity of bones and teeth, as it forms a key component of hydroxyapatite, the mineralized matrix in bone tissue. While some descriptions emphasize energy production, others highlight energy storage and transfer, and while the primary functions are consistent, the nuances of energy metabolism and cellular function are interlinked. The descriptions collectively affirm that phosphorus is not only essential for skeletal health but also for cellular processes, including membrane structure and metabolic activity. Although some sources mention specific foods with greater detail, the overarching theme remains consistent: phosphorus is a fundamental mineral found in both animal and plant-based diets, supporting multiple physiological systems. Contradictions in the specific functions—such as energy production versus energy storage—are resolved by recognizing that phosphorus supports both processes, with energy storage being a primary role in long-term metabolic balance and energy production being key for immediate cellular activity. All descriptions converge on the conclusion that phosphorus is indispensable for human health, present in a broad spectrum of commonly consumed foods, and integral to both structural and metabolic functions. This comprehensive role makes phosphorus a cornerstone nutrient in balanced nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 581, "total_tokens": 1017, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
