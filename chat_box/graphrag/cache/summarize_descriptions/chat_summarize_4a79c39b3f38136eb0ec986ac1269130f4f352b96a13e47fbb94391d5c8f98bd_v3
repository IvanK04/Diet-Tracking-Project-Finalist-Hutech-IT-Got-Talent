This approach emphasizes the inclusion of nutrient-dense plant-based ingredients such as coconut water, bean sprouts, celery, green peas, and water spinach. These foods are particularly effective in promoting weight loss due to their low caloric content and high fiber levels, which help regulate appetite and improve digestive function. Coconut water, while naturally sweet, provides hydration and electrolytes without significant caloric burden, making it a suitable addition to a weight-loss regimen. Bean sprouts and green peas contribute essential proteins and vitamins while remaining low in fat and calories. Celery, known for its high water content and minimal caloric value, further supports satiety and reduces overall food intake. Water spinach, specifically noted for its high fiber and low calorie profile, plays a key role in this dietary strategy by enhancing digestive efficiency and reducing hunger pangs. Collectively, these foods form a balanced, sustainable eating pattern that aligns with the principles of GIẢM_CÂN. The practice is not merely about restricting calories but about optimizing food quality to support long-term weight management. All described components—coconut water, bean sprouts, celery, green peas, and water spinach—are consistent in their contribution to a low-calorie, fiber-rich diet that promotes effective and healthy weight loss. There are no contradictory elements among the descriptions; each reinforces the central theme of using natural, plant-based, low-calorie foods to achieve and maintain a reduced body weight. Therefore, GIẢM_CÂN is best understood as a holistic dietary approach that leverages the nutritional benefits of specific vegetables and beverages to support sustainable weight reduction. This method emphasizes natural, accessible ingredients that are both effective and safe for regular consumption. The integration of these foods into daily meals or snacks provides a practical and scientifically supported pathway for individuals seeking to lose weight in a healthy and balanced manner.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 605, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
