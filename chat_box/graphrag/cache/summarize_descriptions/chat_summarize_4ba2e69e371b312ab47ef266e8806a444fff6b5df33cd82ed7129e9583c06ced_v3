It plays a critical role in maintaining healthy neurological function and supporting cellular metabolism. While it is commonly associated with animal-based sources, Vitamin B12 is found in a variety of foods, including organ meats such as chicken hearts and livers, where it is particularly abundant. Ground pork, both raw and cooked, also contains measurable levels of Vitamin B12, contributing to its dietary availability in certain meat products. Although some sources suggest the presence of Vitamin B12 in coconut water, this claim is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely a misattribution or error, as coconut water does not contain significant or biologically active levels of Vitamin B12. Therefore, the primary dietary sources of Vitamin B12 are animal-derived foods, especially organ meats and meat products like ground pork. The nutrient's importance in preventing deficiencies linked to anemia and neurological disorders underscores its role in human health. Despite its presence in certain animal products, Vitamin B12 is not naturally found in plant-based foods, making it a key nutrient for individuals following omnivorous or meat-based diets. In summary, Vitamin B12 is best recognized as a nutrient predominantly found in organ meats and other animal products, where it supports red blood cell production and neurological integrity. Its presence in foods like chicken hearts, livers, and ground pork confirms its concentration in high-quality animal sources, while any mention of it in non-animal sources such as coconut water is inaccurate and should be disregarded. This comprehensive understanding highlights the importance of including reliable animal-based sources in diets to ensure adequate intake of Vitamin B12.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 575, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
