This attribute is consistently applied across a variety of Vietnamese dishes, including Phở bò tái gầu, Bánh canh sườn heo, Cơm rang dưa bò, Miến riêu cua (nước), Bún đậu mắm tôm, lòng lợn, Bún nem cua bể, Bánh mì thập cẩm, Bánh tráng trộn, and Cháo thịt. The protein content in these dishes is explicitly noted in some cases—for instance, Bánh mì thập cẩm contains 30.6g of protein per serving—demonstrating the measurable nutritional value associated with the HIGH_PROTEIN designation.\n\nThe category functions both as a nutritional attribute and a health tag, emphasizing the dish’s high protein content and its benefits for muscle growth, tissue repair, and overall recovery. It is not limited to a single type of cuisine or preparation method, but rather spans diverse dishes that incorporate protein-rich ingredients such as meat, fish, offal, and legumes. The consistency of the tag across different dishes suggests that HIGH_PROTEIN is a standardized classification used in nutritional labeling and health recommendations, particularly within the context of fitness and wellness diets.\n\nDespite minor variations in phrasing—such as \"high protein\" versus \"high-protein\"—the core meaning remains unified: the presence of substantial protein content that supports physiological needs. The term is used in both descriptive and functional contexts, serving both as a label for consumers and as a criterion for dietary planning. Its application to dishes like Bún nem cua bể and Bánh tráng trộn indicates that even traditionally balanced or savory dishes can be categorized under HIGH_PROTEIN due to their protein density.\n\nNo contradictions are present in the provided descriptions. All references align in defining HIGH_PROTEIN as a health-related attribute tied to high protein content, with clear examples and functional purposes. The term is not used in a contradictory or ambiguous way, and all descriptions reinforce its role in promoting muscle development and recovery. While some dishes may contain other nutritional components, the consistent emphasis on protein content ensures that HIGH_PROTEIN remains a reliable indicator of nutritional value in this context.\n\nIn summary, HIGH_PROTEIN is a well-defined, widely applied health tag and dietary category that identifies meals with significant protein content. It is particularly relevant for individuals engaged in physical activity, muscle development, or post-exercise recovery. By highlighting dishes such as Bánh mì thập cẩm, Cháo thịt, and various noodle and rice-based meals, the category supports informed dietary choices and promotes awareness of protein-rich options within traditional and modern Vietnamese cuisine.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 577, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 973, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
