It is particularly vital for cognitive development in infants and children, underscoring its importance in early life nutrition. Iodine supports overall thyroid function and metabolic regulation, making it a fundamental component of human health. To ensure adequate intake, iodine is commonly added to table salt, serving as a key nutritional supplement in public health strategies to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. This fortification practice helps maintain sufficient iodine levels in populations, especially in regions where dietary sources may be insufficient. While iodine is naturally present in certain foods such as catfish fillet, pears, and mangosteen, its concentration in these sources is generally low, and dietary intake alone may not meet recommended levels. Therefore, supplementation through salt remains a reliable and effective method for ensuring widespread availability. The mineral's role in thyroid hormone synthesis is well-established, and its deficiency has been linked to conditions such as goiter, hypothyroidism, and developmental delays. Despite some descriptions mentioning specific food sources, the primary and most consistent function of iodine across all references is its indispensable role in thyroid function and metabolic regulation. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all align in emphasizing iodine’s necessity for thyroid health and metabolic balance. The information collectively confirms that iodine is not only a trace mineral but a critical nutrient with broad physiological implications. Its presence in both dietary sources and fortified foods highlights its importance in both individual and population-level health. In summary, iodine is a vital trace mineral essential for thyroid hormone production, metabolic regulation, and healthy development, with widespread public health strategies relying on salt fortification to ensure adequate intake.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 692, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
