It is widely distributed across various food sources, including nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, corn, whole chicken, citrus fruits, strawberries, tofu, peanut butter, and certain herbs such as bưởi chùm (pompom mandarin) and ngò tây (coriander). Additionally, it is found in cải bó xôi (red cabbage), further expanding its dietary presence. While some descriptions mention specific fruits like strawberries and citrus, others highlight plant-based sources such as nuts, seeds, and oils, which are particularly rich in this vitamin. The consistent theme across all descriptions is that Vitamin E functions as a protective agent against oxidative stress, contributing to the maintenance of skin health and immune system function. Although one description incorrectly lists \"strawberries\" as a source of Vitamin E, this is likely a data error, as strawberries are not a significant source of Vitamin E compared to other listed foods. Similarly, the inclusion of \"cải bó xôi\" and \"ngò tây\" as sources of Vitamin E may reflect regional dietary practices or specific preparations, but these are not well-documented in mainstream nutritional science. Nonetheless, the overall consensus supports the presence of Vitamin E in a broad range of plant-based and animal-based foods. The vitamin's role in preserving cell integrity and supporting immune and skin health remains well-established. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of Vitamin E reveals it as a vital nutrient found in diverse dietary sources, primarily in fats and oils, nuts, seeds, and certain vegetables and animal products. Its antioxidant properties make it essential for mitigating cellular damage caused by free radicals. Despite minor inconsistencies in specific food associations, the core scientific facts about Vitamin E—its fat-soluble nature, antioxidant function, and protective role in health—remain consistent and reliable.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 697, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
