It is composed of approximately 90% saturated fat, with the majority of this fat consisting of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). These MCTs are efficiently metabolized by the body and are rapidly converted into energy, making coconut oil a popular choice in both culinary and health-related contexts. The oil possesses a distinct tropical flavor, which contributes to its use in a variety of cooking applications, including frying, baking, and as a base for sauces and dressings. Its unique composition and energy-boosting properties have led to widespread use in dietary supplements, skincare products, and traditional medicine. While the primary source of the oil is the coconut flesh, the extraction process preserves its natural composition, ensuring that the resulting product retains its characteristic properties. Coconut oil is valued not only for its flavor and versatility in the kitchen but also for its potential health benefits, such as supporting metabolism and providing a stable energy source. Despite variations in processing methods, all available descriptions consistently affirm that coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, predominantly MCTs, and is known for its quick energy delivery and tropical taste. There are no contradictory elements among the provided descriptions, and all information aligns in supporting the oil’s origin, composition, and functional uses. Therefore, the comprehensive profile of coconut oil reflects a well-established natural product with both culinary and wellness applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
