This category is applied across a variety of dishes, reflecting its broad relevance in meal planning and nutritional guidance. Key dishes associated with the HIGH-PROTEIN category include *Rau cải chíp xào nấm*, *Cá trôi rán sốt cà chua*, *Cá rô đồng rán*, *Cá rô phi rán*, *Xôi trắng*, *Mỳ vằn thắn*, and *Cơm rang thập cẩm*. Each of these meals is specifically categorized under the high-protein health tag, emphasizing their protein content and suitability for targeted dietary needs.\n\nThe inclusion of fish-based dishes such as *Cá trôi rán sốt cà chua*, *Cá rô đồng rán*, and *Cá rô phi rán* highlights the category’s focus on animal-derived proteins, which are particularly effective in supporting muscle growth and repair. These dishes are explicitly recommended for individuals seeking to build or maintain muscle mass and strength, underscoring the category’s role in fitness-oriented nutrition. Meanwhile, dishes like *Xôi trắng* (white sticky rice) and *Mỳ vằn thắn* (a type of noodle dish) are included due to their protein-rich components, such as added meats or legumes, which contribute to a balanced and nutrient-dense meal. *Cơm rang thập cẩm* (mixed stir-fried rice) is also classified under this category, likely due to its combination of protein-rich ingredients such as eggs, meat, or beans, making it a versatile option for those aiming to gain weight in a healthy manner.\n\nDespite some initial ambiguity in the descriptions—such as the inclusion of *Rau cải chíp xào nấm*, a dish traditionally composed of fermented vegetables and thinly sliced greens—its classification as a high-protein meal suggests that it contains added protein sources, such as ground meat or protein-rich seasonings, which aligns with the overall intent of the HIGH-PROTEIN category. This interpretation resolves any contradiction between plant-based and protein-rich meal classifications, as the category is not limited to exclusively animal proteins but includes meals where protein content is enhanced through intentional ingredient selection.\n\nThe HIGH-PROTEIN category functions as a flexible and inclusive framework within the menu, allowing for both traditional and modern dishes to be evaluated based on their protein density. It serves as a practical tool for diners with specific health or fitness objectives, enabling them to make informed choices that support their nutritional goals. Whether through fish-based preparations, grain-based meals with added protein, or vegetable-based dishes enriched with protein sources, the category ensures that a wide range of meals meet the criteria for high protein content. This comprehensive approach not only supports muscle development and strength but also contributes to overall nutritional balance, making HIGH-PROTEIN a valuable and accessible dietary classification in both health and culinary contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 621, "prompt_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 997, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
