These peppers are widely used in global cuisines to add both natural heat and vibrant color to sauces, stews, soups, and a variety of cooked dishes. Their high capsaicin content contributes to their spicy flavor, making them a key ingredient in many hot spice blends and condiments. Beyond their culinary function, dried peppers are a nutritious food source, containing essential nutrients such as vitamin C and a range of minerals including potassium, magnesium, and iron. These nutritional benefits support immune function and overall health when incorporated into balanced diets. Dried peppers are commonly used as a spice in seasoning blends, ground into powders, or rehydrated before use to enhance flavor and texture in recipes. Their versatility allows them to be used in both traditional and modern cooking across diverse cultural food systems, from South Asian curries to Mexican salsas and African stews. While the drying process concentrates capsaicin and other bioactive compounds, it also preserves the essential flavor profile and color of the original pepper. The use of dried peppers not only reduces food waste by extending the shelf life of fresh peppers but also enables consistent flavor delivery in long-term food storage and preparation. Overall, DRIED PEPPERS serve as both a flavorful and health-promoting ingredient, bridging culinary tradition with nutritional value in global food practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
