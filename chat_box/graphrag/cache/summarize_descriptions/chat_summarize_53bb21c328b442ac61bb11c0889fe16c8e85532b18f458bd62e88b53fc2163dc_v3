This tag applies to a range of foods, including coconut water and bean sprouts, which are confirmed to be suitable for vegan consumption. The inclusion of coconut water—commonly recognized as a naturally derived, non-animal beverage—alongside bean sprouts, a nutrient-rich, minimally processed plant food, underscores the category's alignment with core vegan principles of avoiding animal products. Additionally, sunflower seeds are explicitly marked with the \"phù hợp vegan\" (suitable for vegans) tag, affirming their status as a plant-based, non-animal food. This classification emphasizes that all items bearing the PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN designation are free from animal by-products and are composed solely of plant-based components, making them suitable for individuals adhering to vegan lifestyles. The consistency across multiple food items—such as coconut water, bean sprouts, and sunflower seeds—demonstrates a clear and unified standard within the system for identifying vegan-compatible foods. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all instances reinforce the idea that PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN signifies suitability for vegan diets. The term is not limited to a single food type but serves as a broad health and dietary tag applied across various plant-based products. This ensures that consumers and dietary planners can reliably identify foods that align with vegan nutritional guidelines. The use of the term \"phù hợp vegan\" reflects a culturally and contextually appropriate labeling system, particularly in regions where plant-based diets are gaining prominence. Overall, PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN functions as a reliable and consistent indicator of vegan compatibility, supporting informed dietary choices and promoting the accessibility of plant-based options across diverse food categories.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
