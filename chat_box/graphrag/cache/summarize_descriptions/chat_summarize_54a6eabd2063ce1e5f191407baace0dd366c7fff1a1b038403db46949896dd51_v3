It functions as a coenzyme in various biochemical reactions, playing a critical role in converting food into usable energy. Riboflavin is also vital for red blood cell formation, supporting healthy hematopoiesis and overall oxygen transport in the body. Additionally, it contributes to cellular function, skin health, and metabolic well-being.  \n\nThis vitamin is widely distributed across a diverse range of dietary sources. It is found in animal-based foods such as whole chicken, beef sausage, fish, dairy products (including milk and eggs), and scallops. Plant-based sources include leafy greens, peas, onions, corn, strawberries, artichokes, dill, and green vegetables. It is also present in various fruits such as citrus fruits, bưởi chùm (a type of citrus), and ngò tây (a type of herb). Other notable sources include red chili peppers, ridge gourd, tofu, peanut butter, and egg noodles, including fried chicken-style northeast varieties.  \n\nThe presence of riboflavin in both animal and plant-based foods underscores its broad dietary availability. Its role in energy metabolism and red blood cell formation makes it a key nutrient for maintaining physical and metabolic health. While some descriptions mention specific regional or cultural food items (such as cải bó xôi), these are consistent with broader dietary patterns and do not introduce contradictions. All provided information aligns in emphasizing riboflavin’s central role in energy production, cellular function, and metabolic health.  \n\nIn summary, riboflavin is a fundamental B vitamin involved in energy conversion, red blood cell formation, and cellular metabolism. It is found in a wide array of foods, from animal products like dairy and poultry to plant-based sources such as vegetables, fruits, and herbs, making it accessible across diverse diets. Its essential nature and widespread presence in the food supply highlight its importance in human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 589, "total_tokens": 995, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
