Found naturally in various marine sources such as salmon and sea bass, these fatty acids contribute to the maintenance of healthy heart function and help regulate inflammatory processes in the body. Their presence in fatty fish like salmon and sea bass underscores their importance in dietary health, as they are vital for both cardiovascular and neurological well-being. While the specific mention of \"Salmon Atlantis\" appears in the first description, this likely refers to a product or brand name rather than a recognized species of fish, and thus does not alter the scientific or nutritional basis of omega-3 fatty acids. Therefore, the accurate and consistent representation of the entity is grounded in the well-established biological and health benefits associated with omega-3 fatty acids derived from whole, natural sources such as sea bass and salmon. These nutrients are integral to reducing chronic inflammation, which is linked to a range of diseases, and are also crucial for brain development and cognitive function. The health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids are supported by extensive scientific research, highlighting their role in maintaining optimal heart health and supporting neurological integrity. In dietary contexts, consuming fatty fish rich in omega-3s—such as salmon and sea bass—is recommended as part of a balanced, heart-healthy diet. The descriptions collectively affirm that omega-3 fatty acids are not only essential for human health but also widely available in common marine foods. Any discrepancies in naming, such as \"Salmon Atlantis,\" are likely non-scientific or commercial references and do not contradict the core nutritional facts. Thus, the comprehensive summary of OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS reflects their proven benefits in reducing inflammation, supporting cardiovascular and neurological health, and their natural occurrence in whole sea fish like salmon and sea bass. This unified understanding emphasizes their value as a foundational component of a healthy diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 591, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
