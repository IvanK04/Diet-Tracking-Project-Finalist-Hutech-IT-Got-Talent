It is a key ingredient in traditional recipes such as Lòng xào dưa, where it adds a distinctive acidity and complexity that balances the richness of other components. The pickling process typically involves fermenting vegetables, most commonly cucumbers, in a brine solution, resulting in a vibrant, sour taste that is both appetizing and culturally significant.

Its use in Lòng xào dưa—where it is stir-fried with tripe—demonstrates its versatility and importance in everyday meals. While the descriptions provided emphasize its role in enhancing flavor and its presence in specific dishes, they consistently highlight the same core function: providing a sharp, tangy note that complements other ingredients.
