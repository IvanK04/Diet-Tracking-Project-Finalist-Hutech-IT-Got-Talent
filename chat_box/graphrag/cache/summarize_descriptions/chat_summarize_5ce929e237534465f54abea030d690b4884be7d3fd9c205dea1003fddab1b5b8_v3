It is essential for converting food into usable energy and supports various physiological processes, including DNA repair and cellular maintenance. Found in a wide range of dietary sources, NIACIN is present in meats such as chicken wings and fish, as well as plant-based foods including green cabbage, leafy greens, amaranth, kale, citrus fruits, cinnamon, lemon, and galangal. Additionally, it is detected in vegetables like cucumber and tomato, contributing to both metabolic and skin-related functions. The presence of NIACIN in diverse foods—ranging from animal proteins to various vegetables and herbs—demonstrates its broad dietary availability and functional importance. While some descriptions highlight its role in skin health, others emphasize its contribution to nervous system function, particularly in the context of galangal and fish consumption. These findings collectively affirm that NIACIN supports not only metabolic efficiency but also the integrity of skin and neural systems. Although there are minor variations in the specific food sources cited across descriptions, the core functions—energy metabolism, skin health, and nervous system support—remain consistent and non-contradictory. The inclusion of both animal and plant-based sources underscores its accessibility across different dietary patterns. It is important to note that while some sources mention DNA repair, this function is less frequently emphasized and appears to be a secondary or supportive role compared to energy metabolism and skin health. Overall, NIACIN functions as a foundational nutrient in human physiology, enabling efficient energy production and contributing to the health of skin and the nervous system. Its presence in common foods such as leafy greens, meats, citrus fruits, and herbs makes it a widely available and essential component of a balanced diet. The consistent identification of NIACIN across multiple sources as a B-vitamin involved in energy metabolism and skin health, with additional support for nervous system function, provides a unified and coherent picture of its biological significance. This comprehensive role highlights the importance of adequate NIACIN intake for optimal metabolic and physiological well-being.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 434, "prompt_tokens": 372, "total_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
