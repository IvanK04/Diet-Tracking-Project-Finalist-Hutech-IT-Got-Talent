It plays a critical role in converting food into usable energy through its involvement in cellular respiration, particularly in the production of ATP. As a coenzyme in key metabolic pathways, niacin supports the function of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and the breakdown of carbohydrates and fats. Additionally, niacin contributes to maintaining healthy skin by supporting the integrity of the skin barrier and promoting the production of skin cells, which helps in preventing dryness and other skin conditions. Its role in digestion is also notable, as it aids in the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal tract by supporting the metabolism of nutrients and the maintenance of mucosal health.  \n\nNiacin (B3) is naturally found in a variety of dietary sources, including coconut and mango, which contribute to its availability in plant-based diets. These foods provide a bioavailable form of the vitamin, allowing individuals to meet their daily requirements through a balanced and diverse diet. While niacin is commonly associated with its metabolic functions, its importance in skin health makes it a valuable nutrient for individuals concerned with dermatological well-being.  \n\nOverall, NIACIN (B3) serves as a foundational nutrient in human health, supporting both internal metabolic processes and external physiological conditions such as skin integrity. Its presence in common fruits and tropical foods like coconut and mango underscores its accessibility and relevance in everyday nutrition. By fulfilling its roles in energy production, digestion, and skin maintenance, niacin (B3) remains a vital component of a healthy diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
