This designation emphasizes the food's composition as free from animal-derived ingredients, aligning with vegan dietary principles. The tag is consistently applied to various foods, including both bưởi chùm and ngò tây, confirming their suitability for vegan consumption. While the presence of fermentation byproducts—such as those found in dưa cải muối—may introduce minor non-plant-based components, the overall classification still considers the food vegan-friendly, as these byproducts are typically derived from plant sources and do not involve animal products. Therefore, despite potential minor complexities in fermentation processes, the food is generally regarded as appropriate for vegan diets. The attribute serves as a clear indicator for consumers seeking plant-based options, ensuring transparency in dietary suitability. PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN is not merely a label but a comprehensive health descriptor that reflects both the absence of animal ingredients and the plant-based foundation of the food. It is applied across a range of items, reinforcing its role in supporting dietary choices aligned with vegan lifestyles. Although some fermented foods may contain trace elements not strictly plant-based, the overarching classification remains valid due to the absence of animal components. This consistency across different foods strengthens the reliability of the PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN tag as a trusted indicator of vegan compatibility. In summary, PHÙ_HỢP_VEGETARIAN denotes that the food is suitable for vegan diets, composed of plant-based ingredients, and free from animal products, with minor fermentation byproducts not altering its fundamental suitability. This attribute supports informed dietary decisions and promotes inclusivity in food labeling for plant-based consumers.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 618, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
