It plays a vital role in supporting eye health, immune function, and overall cellular defense by reducing oxidative stress. In Nộm rau muống, beta-carotene is present in high concentrations—13,994 µg—contributing significantly to eye health and immune support. Similarly, in Goi xoai, it is found in moderate amounts (1,207 µg), where it supports immune function and acts as an antioxidant, enhancing immune defense and reducing oxidative damage. In pumpkin and bí đỏ hồ lô, beta-carotene functions as a vital precursor to vitamin A, directly supporting eye health and immune function. Additionally, red bell peppers are a notable source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A and contributes to eye health, skin health, and immune function, underscoring its importance in the nutritional profile of this vegetable. Across these diverse food sources, beta-carotene consistently demonstrates its role in promoting health through immune modulation and protection against oxidative stress. While the concentration varies—ranging from 1,207 µg in Goi xoai to 13,994 µg in Nộm rau muống—its biological functions remain consistent, highlighting its value as a key nutrient in plant-based diets. The presence of beta-carotene in these foods reflects its widespread availability and essential role in maintaining visual acuity, immune resilience, and overall well-being. Despite minor variations in reported quantities, all descriptions converge on the same core benefits: conversion to vitamin A, antioxidant activity, and support for eye and immune health. Thus, beta-carotene stands out as a versatile and essential nutrient derived from plant sources, contributing significantly to human health through multiple dietary pathways.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 426, "total_tokens": 812, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
