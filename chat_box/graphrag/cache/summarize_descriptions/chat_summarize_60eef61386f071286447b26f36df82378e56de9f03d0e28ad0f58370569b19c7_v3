It reflects a diverse range of dishes that are both nutritious and easily digestible, making them suitable for starting the day. Commonly included in Ăn sáng are xôi (sticky rice), xôi xéo (a variation of sticky rice with added ingredients like pork or vegetables), and bánh mì thập cẩm (a mixed sandwich often featuring various fillings such as meat, cheese, and vegetables). These dishes are widely available in Vietnamese households and restaurants, serving as a staple part of morning meals. Additionally, warm and comforting options such as Cháo sườn (pork porridge) and Cháo đậu đen đường (black beans porridge with sugar) are also frequently consumed as part of Ăn sáng, offering both sustenance and cultural significance. While some descriptions emphasize the inclusion of bánh cuốn thịt (steamed rice rolls with meat), this appears less central than the core dishes like xôi and bánh mì thập cẩm. The consistency across multiple descriptions confirms that Ăn sáng is not limited to a single dish but represents a broad category of morning meals that vary by region and household preference. The meal is often associated with family traditions and daily life, reinforcing its importance in Vietnamese culture. Despite minor variations in specific dish listings, all sources converge on the idea that Ăn sáng is a foundational and culturally significant part of Vietnamese breakfast practices. It serves both practical and social functions, providing energy and offering opportunities for communal eating. The meal’s popularity and adaptability highlight its role in sustaining daily routines and preserving cultural identity. In summary, Ăn sáng is a traditional, warm, and varied Vietnamese breakfast that combines staple foods like sticky rice, porridge, and sandwiches, reflecting the richness and diversity of Vietnamese culinary life.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 377, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 686, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
