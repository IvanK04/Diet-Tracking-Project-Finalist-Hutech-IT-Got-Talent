This attribute serves as an indicator of the dish's nutritional value, particularly in supporting bone health due to calcium's essential role in maintaining strong bones and teeth. The presence of HIGH_CALCIUM is consistently applied across various menu items, signaling that the dish provides a significant source of this vital mineral. It is not limited to a single ingredient but may be found in combinations where calcium is contributed by multiple sources, including dairy and fortified additives. The tag is recognized as a health-related feature, emphasizing both the nutritional benefit and the dietary relevance of the dish. While the specific amounts of calcium may vary, the tag collectively signifies a substantial calcium content that contributes positively to overall wellness. There are no contradictory elements among the provided descriptions; all consistently point to HIGH_CALCIUM as a marker of high calcium content, linked to dairy and fortified ingredients, and associated with benefits for bone health. The attribute is used systematically across different dishes, reinforcing its role as a reliable indicator of nutritional quality. Therefore, any dish bearing the HIGH_CALCIUM tag can be confidently described as a source of calcium, supporting dietary recommendations for individuals seeking to meet their daily calcium needs. This makes HIGH_CALCIUM a valuable tool in nutritional labeling and consumer guidance, especially for those managing bone health or following diets that emphasize mineral-rich foods. The consistency across descriptions ensures that the definition remains clear and coherent, avoiding ambiguity. In summary, HIGH_CALCIUM is a well-defined health attribute that highlights the presence of calcium in food, primarily from dairy and fortified sources, and underscores its importance in promoting strong, healthy bones.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
