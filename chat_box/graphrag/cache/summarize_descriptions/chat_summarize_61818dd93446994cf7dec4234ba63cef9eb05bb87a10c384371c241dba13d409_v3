This extensive range is renowned for its high-altitude environments, which have historically supported unique agricultural practices, including the long-standing cultivation of quinoa. For centuries, indigenous communities in the Andes have grown quinoa as a staple crop, adapting to the region’s challenging climate and elevation. The mountain range's diverse ecosystems and altitudinal gradients have enabled the development of sustainable farming techniques that have preserved quinoa’s nutritional value and cultural significance. The Andes not only serve as the geographical origin of quinoa but also as a vital center for agricultural heritage, where traditional knowledge continues to influence modern farming methods. This deep-rooted connection between the Andes and quinoa underscores the region’s importance in both food security and cultural preservation. The high-altitude agriculture found throughout the Andes supports a wide variety of crops beyond quinoa, contributing to the region’s biodiversity and resilience. Overall, the Andes stand as a key geographical and cultural hub for quinoa, where centuries of sustainable cultivation have shaped both the crop’s development and the livelihoods of local populations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
