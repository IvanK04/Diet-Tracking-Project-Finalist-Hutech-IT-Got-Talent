It is widely distributed across a variety of plant-based foods, including bưởi chùm (a type of citrus fruit), ngò tây (a type of herb), red chili peppers, strawberries, and tofu. These sources highlight its presence in both fruits and vegetables, as well as in legumes and plant-based proteins. While some descriptions mention corn as a source of Vitamin C, this is inconsistent with established nutritional data, which indicates that corn contains only trace amounts of the vitamin and is not a significant source. Therefore, corn is excluded from the primary list of reliable sources. The consistent and scientifically supported roles of Vitamin C include enhancing immune defense, protecting cells from oxidative damage, and facilitating the synthesis of collagen, a key structural protein in skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Its presence in red chili peppers contributes not only to immune support but also to the strong, vibrant flavor of these foods. Similarly, strawberries and bưởi chùm are recognized as rich sources of Vitamin C, offering both health benefits and dietary variety. The inclusion of ngò tây underscores the vitamin’s presence in herbs, adding to its dietary diversity. Although tofu is noted as a source, its Vitamin C content is minimal compared to fruits and vegetables, and thus it is mentioned with caution. Overall, Vitamin C is best obtained through a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, where it plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and supporting the body’s natural defenses. The comprehensive evidence from multiple sources confirms that Vitamin C is a critical nutrient with broad physiological benefits, primarily derived from natural, plant-based foods.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 643, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
