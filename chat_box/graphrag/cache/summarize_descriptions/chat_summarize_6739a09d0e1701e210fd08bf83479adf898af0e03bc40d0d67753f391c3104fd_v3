It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including grilling, sautéing, boiling, pan-searing, and roasting, and is essential in both home and professional kitchens. Cooking involves the use of diverse ingredients such as chicken, lime, honeydew, shrimp, pork, mushrooms, onions, beef mince, and raw sausages, which are combined to create balanced and flavorful meals. Specific dishes like phồng tôm (shrimp with mushrooms), mộc nhĩ xào thịt nạc (mushrooms sautéed with lean pork), pork rib chops, and white rice are commonly prepared through these methods. Food safety is a central concern in cooking, with precise temperature guidelines ensuring safe consumption. For instance, raw beef mince must be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 160°F (71°C), while raw pork sausages and pork rib chops should reach 145°F (63°C) to eliminate harmful pathogens. This process not only ensures safety but also contributes to improved digestibility and overall quality. Cooking is particularly vital when preparing raw sausages, where thorough heating results in a juicy interior and a crispy outer layer when fried or grilled. Additionally, techniques such as grilling are used to enhance the flavor and texture of dishes like grilled goose eggs. Whether preparing simple meals or complex dishes, cooking serves as a critical step in transforming raw ingredients into safe, enjoyable, and nutritionally balanced food. The process is both an art and a science, combining traditional methods with modern food safety standards to deliver consistent, high-quality results.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 471, "total_tokens": 821, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
