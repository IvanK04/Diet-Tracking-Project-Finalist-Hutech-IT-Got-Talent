The fish is thus recognized not only for its culinary appeal but also for its health benefits, making it a popular choice in traditional seafood dishes. Its unique combination of firm texture, robust flavor, and nutritional value underscores its significance in both local cuisine and dietary wellness. The omega-3 fatty acids present in the meat contribute to reducing inflammation, supporting cardiovascular health, and promoting healthy brain development.
