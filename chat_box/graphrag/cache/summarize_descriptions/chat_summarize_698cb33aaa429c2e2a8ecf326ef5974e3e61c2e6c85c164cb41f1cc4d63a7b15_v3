It is particularly crucial for muscle and nerve function, energy production, bone health, and maintaining healthy blood pressure. Its involvement in metabolic and neurological processes underscores its importance in overall health and homeostasis. Magnesium is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including leafy greens such as kale, spinach, and green cabbage; nuts like walnuts and almonds; whole grains; seeds; and various fruits and vegetables such as cucumber, tomato, garlic, and mango. It is also found in animal-based foods including pork liver, fish fillets, chicken wings, and seafood like squid and grouper. Plant-based sources such as amaranth, galangal, brown sugar, and sunflower oil further contribute to dietary magnesium intake. Additionally, magnesium is present in common foods like lemon, peanut oil, and coconut, highlighting its broad presence in both plant and animal diets. While some descriptions mention specific food sources with minor variations, these are consistent with a general pattern of magnesium being abundant in both plant and animal products. The repeated emphasis on its role in enzymatic reactions—particularly those related to energy metabolism, muscle contraction, and nerve signaling—demonstrates its foundational role in cellular function. Although some descriptions lack specific food references, the consistent theme across all sources confirms magnesium’s widespread availability and multifaceted biological significance. Contradictions in the specific food sources are resolved by recognizing that the list includes overlapping and varied examples, all pointing to a common nutritional profile. Therefore, magnesium is not only a key mineral for maintaining normal muscle and nerve activity but also a critical component in energy production, bone formation, and cardiovascular health. Its presence in diverse foods ensures that it can be obtained through a wide range of dietary choices, making it accessible and essential for a balanced diet. Overall, magnesium stands as a fundamental nutrient, supporting vital bodily functions through its extensive involvement in biochemical pathways and its presence in a broad spectrum of commonly consumed foods.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 420, "prompt_tokens": 631, "total_tokens": 1051, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
