This sauce delivers a vibrant, balanced flavor profile characterized by a bright citrus note complemented by rich, buttery undertones, making it a popular choice as a topping for cakes, sweets, and fruit-based desserts. Each 15-gram serving contains 38.7 calories, 0.93 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrates, and 13.16 grams of fat, with a significant portion coming from saturated fats. The high fat and sugar content contributes to its caloric density, necessitating portion control for individuals managing their dietary intake, particularly those concerned with cardiovascular health or weight management.\n\nNutritionally, the sauce contains a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, D, E, K, folate, and various B vitamins, as well as essential minerals such as iron, zinc, copper, iodine, calcium, selenium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, phosphorus, chromium, molybdenum, chlorine, and sodium. While the presence of vitamin C supports immune function and antioxidant activity, the overall nutritional profile is dominated by added sugars and saturated fats, which are common in processed food items. These components may pose health risks when consumed in excess, especially over prolonged periods.\n\nDespite its appealing flavor and some beneficial micronutrients, SWEETENED LEMON BUTTER SAUCE is classified as a processed food product that may contain allergens such as saturated fats and other processed ingredients. The combination of sugar and butter contributes to a high glycemic impact, which can affect blood glucose levels, particularly in individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. Additionally, the high fat content raises concerns about long-term health outcomes, including increased cholesterol levels and potential cardiovascular strain.\n\nThe sauce is not a natural or minimally processed food; rather, it is formulated through a reduction process that concentrates flavors and increases sugar and fat content. This processing enhances shelf stability and flavor intensity but at the expense of a more balanced nutritional profile. While it may offer some vitamin and mineral benefits, these are overshadowed by its high caloric and macronutrient density.\n\nIn summary, SWEETENED LEMON BUTTER SAUCE is a flavorful, processed condiment that combines lemon, sugar, and butter to create a rich, citrusy emulsion. It is widely used in desserts and baked goods, but its high levels of sugar, saturated fat, and processed ingredients make it a less ideal choice for regular consumption. Consumers should be mindful of portion sizes and consider healthier alternatives when incorporating it into their diets. Its nutritional value is modest compared to its caloric and fat content, and it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced eating pattern.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 581, "prompt_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 1087, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
