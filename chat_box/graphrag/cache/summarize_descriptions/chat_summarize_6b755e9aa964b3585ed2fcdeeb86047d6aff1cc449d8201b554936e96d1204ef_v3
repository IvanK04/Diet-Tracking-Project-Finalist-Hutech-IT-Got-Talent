This goal is closely associated with the consumption of low-calorie, high-fiber foods that support metabolic balance and satiety. Specific food items linked to GIAM_CAN include ca tim (a type of leafy green often consumed for its nutritional value), Tôm đông lạnh (frozen shrimp), and Cá ngừ vây vàng sống (fresh yellowfin tuna), all of which are valued for their high protein content and low fat content. These dietary choices are believed to promote effective weight management by preserving muscle mass while minimizing caloric intake. The emphasis on protein-rich, low-fat foods aligns with nutritional science principles that support sustainable weight loss through balanced macronutrient intake. While ca tim contributes to fiber intake and digestive health, the inclusion of seafood such as frozen shrimp and fresh yellowfin tuna provides essential amino acids and omega-3 fatty acids, further enhancing the nutritional profile of a GIAM_CAN diet. Although the term is primarily associated with weight loss, it also reflects a broader cultural and dietary awareness in Vietnamese health practices, where traditional foods are reinterpreted for modern wellness goals. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all information consistently supports the idea that GIAM_CAN is a health-oriented dietary strategy centered on weight reduction through specific, nutrient-dense food choices. The term is not a medical diagnosis or treatment but rather a lifestyle or nutritional objective. Overall, GIAM_CAN represents a practical and culturally grounded approach to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through mindful eating habits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 328, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 528, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
