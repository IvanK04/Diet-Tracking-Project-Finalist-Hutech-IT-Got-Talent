It is typically characterized by a fat-to-lean ratio, with common formulations including 90/10 (90% lean, 10% fat) and 80/20 (80% lean, 20% fat), though fat content can range from 15% to 30% depending on the cut and intended use. Leaner varieties, such as 90/10 ground beef, are specifically formulated to reduce saturated fat content, making them a healthier option for consumers seeking lower-fat protein sources. Ground beef is a rich source of high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and various B vitamins, contributing to essential nutritional needs. While higher fat content—such as in 80/20 or 70/30 blends—increases the saturated fat levels, it also enhances flavor and juiciness, which are desirable in many culinary applications. The fat content directly influences both the texture and nutritional profile of the final dish, allowing for flexibility in recipe development. Overall, ground beef serves as a widely consumed and adaptable ingredient in both home cooking and commercial food production, balancing nutritional value with culinary versatility. Its composition and fat content are key factors in determining its suitability for different dietary preferences and health goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 575, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
