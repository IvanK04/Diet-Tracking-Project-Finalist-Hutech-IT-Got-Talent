It is categorized under grains and contains 39 calories per 30 grams, with 2.2 grams of protein, 3.5 grams of carbohydrates, and 1.8 grams of fat. The flour is a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, as well as key minerals such as iron and magnesium. Due to the retention of the bran and germ, whole wheat flour is more nutritious than refined white flour, offering higher levels of dietary fiber and B vitamins. It is commonly used in baking and cooking, and is particularly suitable for bread, pancakes, and cookies. However, its denser texture and slightly bitter taste may require adjustments in recipes, such as adding more liquid, due to its high water absorption capacity. While the provided descriptions do not explicitly state health benefits or dietary restrictions, the presence of fiber and essential nutrients suggests potential advantages for digestive and overall health. WHEAT FLOUR is valued for its versatility and nutritional profile, making it a staple ingredient in many culinary applications. Its whole grain composition supports a more balanced diet compared to refined flours, though individual dietary needs—such as gluten sensitivity—should be considered separately. Overall, WHEAT FLOUR serves as a nutritious, functional ingredient in both traditional and modern food preparation, contributing to a diverse and balanced diet when used appropriately.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 323, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 674, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
