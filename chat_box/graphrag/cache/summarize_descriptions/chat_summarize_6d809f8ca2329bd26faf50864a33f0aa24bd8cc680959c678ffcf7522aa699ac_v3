It plays a key role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, and is vital for detoxification pathways. Molybdenum is found in a variety of plant-based foods, including legumes, grains, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, red pepper flakes, cantaloupe, plums, pears, and sầu riêng. It is also present in ngò tây (a type of herb commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine). While it is present in small amounts in many foods, its concentration is generally low, and it is not abundant in all dietary sources. The mineral supports enzyme activity and metabolic functions, contributing to overall biochemical balance in the body. Although some descriptions mention molybdenum in general terms without specifying food sources, the consistent theme across multiple references is its presence in plant-based foods and its role in enzymatic processes. The mention of molybdenum in the context of a list of minerals without explicit detail is not contradictory, as it simply reflects its recognized status as a trace mineral. All provided descriptions converge on the idea that molybdenum is a trace mineral involved in enzyme function and sulfur amino acid metabolism, with dietary sources primarily derived from vegetables, fruits, legumes, and certain herbs. There are no conflicting claims regarding its biological function or sources; rather, the descriptions reinforce each other by expanding on specific food sources and metabolic roles. Thus, molybdenum is best understood as a widely distributed trace mineral in plant-based diets, essential for enzymatic activity and metabolic detoxification.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 441, "total_tokens": 792, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
