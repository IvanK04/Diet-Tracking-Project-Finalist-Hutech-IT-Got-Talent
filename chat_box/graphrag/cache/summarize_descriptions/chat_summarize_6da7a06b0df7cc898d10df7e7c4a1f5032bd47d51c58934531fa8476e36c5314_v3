It plays a vital role in maintaining proper thyroid function, which in turn supports overall endocrine health and metabolic balance. Found in a variety of dietary sources, iodine is present in seafood, dairy products, and certain vegetables, including kale, cucumber, tomato, green cabbage, and spinach. It is also detected in chicken wings and fish fillets, contributing to metabolic regulation and hormonal equilibrium. While iodine is commonly associated with seafood and dairy, it is also present in plant-based foods such as lemon and cinnamon, though the concentration in these items is generally lower. The mineral's importance spans across multiple food groups, ensuring that individuals can obtain adequate intake through a balanced diet. Although the specific sources of iodine vary slightly across descriptions, the consistent theme is its indispensable role in thyroid function and metabolic processes. Some descriptions highlight its presence in specific vegetables like kale and cucumber, while others emphasize seafood and dairy as primary sources. These variations do not contradict the core function of iodine but rather illustrate the breadth of dietary sources available. The presence of iodine in both animal and plant-based foods underscores its widespread availability in the human diet. All descriptions converge on the central point that iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and the regulation of metabolic rate. This makes it a fundamental nutrient for energy production, growth, and development. Despite minor discrepancies in the specific food items listed—such as lemon and cinnamon being mentioned in some descriptions—these are likely due to the inclusion of trace amounts or less prominent sources. The primary and most significant dietary sources remain seafood, dairy, and certain leafy greens. The consistency across all descriptions confirms that iodine is not only necessary but also widely accessible through common foods. Its role in endocrine health makes it a key component in preventing conditions such as hypothyroidism and goiter. In summary, Iodine is a vital mineral essential for thyroid hormone production and metabolic regulation, found in a diverse range of foods including seafood, dairy, green vegetables, and some fruits and meats. Its presence across both plant and animal-based diets ensures that it can be incorporated into various dietary patterns, supporting optimal health and physiological function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 750, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
