This dietary preference is not only a health consideration but also a key factor in food labeling and nutritional analysis, often accompanied by health warnings to ensure consumer safety. The gluten-free status applies to a variety of foods, including mango and kiwi, which naturally do not contain gluten, and extends to processed items such as rice noodles, which are specifically noted for their gluten-free composition and suitability for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Additionally, gluten-free diets are compatible with certain plant-based foods like kale and mint, which are naturally free of gluten and thus safe for individuals adhering to this dietary regimen. The attribute is also observed in specific dishes such as Xôi xíu and Xôi thập cẩm, where the absence of gluten is a defining characteristic, ensuring these meals are safe for those with gluten-related disorders. While gluten-free is often associated with medical necessity—particularly for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity—it is also adopted as a broader dietary preference, reflecting growing awareness of digestive health and food safety. Importantly, the term \"gluten-free\" is used consistently across different food types and contexts, from fresh fruits to prepared meals, reinforcing its role as a reliable indicator of safety for sensitive individuals. Contradictions in the original descriptions—such as the mention of gluten-free status in both natural and processed foods—are resolved by recognizing that gluten-free is a property that can be inherent (in naturally gluten-free foods like mango and kiwi) or achieved through processing (as in rice noodles and certain dishes). This dual nature underscores the versatility and importance of the gluten-free designation in modern nutrition. Overall, GLUTEN FREE serves as a critical dietary marker that supports health, safety, and inclusivity in food choices, particularly for those with medical conditions or sensitivities. It is a foundational element in both dietary planning and food product development, ensuring that individuals can consume a wide range of foods without risk of adverse reactions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 422, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 717, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
