It plays a critical role in maintaining healthy nerve function and preventing deficiencies that can lead to anemia and neurological disorders. While it is primarily found in animal-based products such as meat, fish, dairy, and eggs, it is also present in certain processed or specific food items, including fried chicken, whole chicken, egg noodles, and traditional dishes like cá rô and pork ears. The presence of VITAMIN_B12 in these foods is often noted in nutritional metadata or health tags, indicating its inclusion in the nutritional profile, even when not explicitly stated in the text. Although some descriptions mention its presence in non-traditional or specific culinary items, the consistent scientific consensus across all sources confirms that VITAMIN_B12 is predominantly derived from animal sources. The information from various descriptions, while occasionally repetitive or contextually specific, converges on a unified understanding: VITAMIN_B12 is vital for physiological health, particularly in red blood cell production and nerve integrity, and is most reliably obtained through animal-derived foods. Despite minor inconsistencies in the phrasing or specific food examples, there are no contradictory claims regarding its biological function or primary dietary sources. All descriptions align in emphasizing its importance for human health and its association with animal-based diets. Therefore, VITAMIN_B12 is best understood as a nutritionally essential vitamin, crucial for maintaining hematological and neurological health, and predominantly sourced from meat, fish, dairy, and eggs, with occasional presence in processed or regional dishes. Its inclusion in food metadata underscores its recognized role in nutritional assessments, even when not directly described in the text.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 413, "total_tokens": 767, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
