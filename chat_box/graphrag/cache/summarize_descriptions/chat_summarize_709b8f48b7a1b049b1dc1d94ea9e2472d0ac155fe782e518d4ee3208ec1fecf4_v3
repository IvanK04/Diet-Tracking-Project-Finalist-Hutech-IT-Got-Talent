It is recognized for its potent antioxidant properties, which help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress. Selenium plays a critical role in supporting thyroid function by aiding in the production and metabolism of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism, growth, and development. Additionally, it contributes to immune system health, enhancing the body’s ability to defend against infections and maintain overall immune balance.  \n\nThe mineral is found in diverse foods such as fish—particularly cod and other seafood—where it is abundant due to the marine environment’s selenium content. It is also present in seeds, including those of sunflower and flax, and in fruits like pineapple and banana, where it supports both antioxidant activity and immune and thyroid health. Spinach and peanut butter are notable plant-based sources, while kumquats offer a citrusy option rich in selenium. Furthermore, selenium is found in animal products such as pork belly and shallots, indicating its presence across both plant and animal-based diets.  \n\nAcross all sources, the consistent theme is selenium’s dual role as a powerful antioxidant and a vital cofactor in thyroid hormone metabolism. While the specific food sources vary, the functional benefits remain aligned: protection against cellular damage, support for thyroid function, and enhancement of immune response. Although some descriptions mention only a single food source, the broader context reveals that selenium is widely available in a range of commonly consumed foods, making it accessible through a balanced diet.  \n\nThere are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all consistently affirm selenium’s role as a trace mineral with antioxidant properties and its importance in thyroid and immune health. The variations in food sources reflect the mineral’s broad dietary distribution rather than conflicting functions. Therefore, a unified and coherent summary can be constructed that reflects both the scientific functions and the diverse dietary origins of selenium.  \n\nIn summary, selenium is a trace mineral essential for human health, found in a wide array of foods including fish, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and animal products. Its antioxidant activity helps protect cells from damage, while its role in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism ensures proper metabolic and developmental functions. By supporting immune function, selenium contributes to the body’s resilience against disease. With its presence in both plant and animal-based foods, selenium is a readily accessible nutrient that can be incorporated into a balanced diet to promote overall well-being. This comprehensive profile underscores selenium’s importance as a vital micronutrient in human nutrition.  \n\n(Word count: 698)", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 525, "prompt_tokens": 318, "total_tokens": 843, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
