It is widely used in cooking and baking due to its sweet flavor and versatility. Weighing 100 grams, white sugar contains 8.28 calories, 2.07 grams of carbohydrates, and no protein or fat. It is categorized under oils and seasonings in food classification systems. While it contains trace amounts of essential minerals—including calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, selenium, and sodium—as well as riboflavin, these nutrients are present in minimal quantities and do not contribute significantly to dietary needs. As a result, white sugar is classified as low in protein, high in carbohydrates, calorie-dense, and composed of empty calories with minimal vitamins. It is allergen-free, making it suitable for individuals with common food allergies. Despite its minimal nutritional value, white sugar plays a significant role in food preparation and flavor enhancement. The product's nutritional profile reflects its primary function as a source of energy rather than a nutrient-dense food. Its high carbohydrate content and lack of essential vitamins and proteins mean it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Although it originates from natural agricultural sources, the refining process removes most of the natural nutrients found in raw sugar, resulting in a product that is primarily composed of sucrose. This processing contributes to its low mineral content and minimal health benefits beyond providing energy. Overall, white sugar is a fundamental ingredient in both home and commercial food production, valued for its sweetness and stability, but it is not recommended as a primary component of a health-conscious diet due to its empty-calorie nature and potential impact on blood sugar levels.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 677, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
