It is produced through polishing, which removes the bran and germ layers, resulting in a refined grain with lower fiber content compared to brown rice. This processing also contributes to its naturally gluten-free nature and neutral flavor, making it highly versatile for use in both savory and sweet dishes across a wide range of cuisines. As a staple food in many cultures, it is widely consumed globally and valued for its ability to complement diverse culinary preparations. While it contains no specific vitamins or minerals listed in the available metadata, it is recognized as a healthy source of energy due to its low fat content and consistent carbohydrate profile. Each 45-gram serving contains approximately 365 calories, providing a reliable source of sustained energy without significant nutritional complexity. Its neutral taste and consistent texture allow it to serve as a foundational ingredient in dishes such as curries, stir-fries, pilafs, and desserts. Despite the absence of detailed micronutrient data, its role in daily diets underscores its importance as a fundamental component of global food systems. The grain's processing results in a refined product with enhanced palatability and shelf stability, though it lacks the fiber and nutrients found in whole grains.
