It supports antioxidant defense mechanisms, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage. Copper is involved in maintaining immune function and the integrity of connective tissue. Found in a wide variety of foods, including black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, pork products, sticky rice, catfish fillet, pears, mangosteen, sunflower seeds, and salmon, copper contributes to overall metabolic and physiological processes. Its presence in plant-based and animal-based foods underscores its broad dietary availability. While copper is essential in small amounts, it is also involved in the efficient conversion of iron into usable forms, which is critical for hemoglobin synthesis and oxygen transport in the blood. The mineral's functions extend beyond red blood cell formation to include enzymatic activities that support cellular energy metabolism and immune response. Although some descriptions mention copper's role in antioxidant defense, others emphasize its role in immune function and iron metabolism, which are interconnected and collectively vital. The information from various food sources confirms copper's presence across both plant and animal-based diets, reinforcing its importance in a balanced diet. Despite minor variations in the specific food sources cited, all descriptions converge on copper’s core biological functions: red blood cell formation, iron metabolism, energy production, and immune support. The Vietnamese description noting copper's role in \"dồi huyết\" (blood production) and \"hạt vừng đen\" (black sesame seeds) aligns with the broader context of iron metabolism and red blood cell formation. Thus, copper stands out as a critical trace mineral with diverse physiological roles, widely distributed in common dietary sources, and essential for maintaining health across multiple systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 797, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
