These essential fatty acids play a vital role in supporting overall health, with notable benefits for heart and brain function. The presence of omega-3s in Cá đối contributes to cardiovascular wellness by helping to reduce inflammation, lower triglyceride levels, and support healthy blood pressure. Additionally, these fatty acids are crucial for optimal brain development and cognitive performance, making Cá đối a valuable dietary source for individuals seeking to enhance mental clarity and neurological health. The omega-3 content in Cá đối is especially prominent in the fatty belly meat, which is often highlighted as the most nutrient-dense part of the fish. While the exact concentration may vary based on diet, environment, and species, the consistent presence of omega-3 fatty acids underscores its nutritional significance. OMEGA-3 is a class of polyunsaturated fats that includes eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both of which are naturally found in fatty fish like Cá đối. These compounds are essential for human health and are not produced in sufficient quantities by the body, making dietary intake critical. Therefore, consuming Cá đối provides a natural and effective way to meet daily omega-3 requirements. The health benefits associated with omega-3 fatty acids extend beyond heart and brain health, potentially supporting joint function, reducing symptoms of inflammation, and promoting healthy skin and immune system function. Overall, Cá đối stands out as a nutritious and accessible source of omega-3 fatty acids, making it a beneficial addition to a balanced diet. Its high concentration of these essential nutrients, especially in the belly meat, positions it as a key dietary component for promoting long-term well-being. While some sources may emphasize different aspects of omega-3 benefits, the consistent theme across all descriptions is the positive impact of omega-3s on heart and brain health, reinforcing the importance of including Cá đối in a health-conscious diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 408, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
