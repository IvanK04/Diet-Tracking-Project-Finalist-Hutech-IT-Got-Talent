It plays a critical role in hematological and neurological health, supporting the production of healthy red blood cells and the proper functioning of the nervous system. While it is most abundantly found in animal-derived products such as meats, fish, chicken wings, and other animal-based foods, it is also present in trace amounts in certain plant-based foods like cucumber and tomato, though these sources are not significant contributors to dietary intake. The presence of Vitamin B12 in foods such as squid and grouper highlights its natural occurrence in marine animals, reinforcing its association with animal products. Although some descriptions suggest that Vitamin B12 is found in plant-based foods like amaranth, this claim is inconsistent with established nutritional science, as amaranth is not a known significant source of Vitamin B12. Therefore, the claim of Vitamin B12 in amaranth is likely erroneous or based on a misunderstanding. The most accurate and scientifically supported information indicates that Vitamin B12 is primarily derived from animal sources, including fish, meats, and poultry, with chicken wings being a specific example of a food item that contains the vitamin and supports both neurological and hematological health. While trace amounts may be detected in certain vegetables, these levels are negligible and do not contribute meaningfully to human dietary needs. Thus, the primary dietary sources of Vitamin B12 remain animal products, and deficiency is most commonly associated with vegetarian or vegan diets that lack these sources. In summary, Vitamin B12 is a vital nutrient for red blood cell formation and neurological function, predominantly found in animal-based foods such as fish, meats, and poultry, with minimal and non-significant presence in plant-based foods like cucumber, tomato, or amaranth. Its essential role in human health underscores the importance of including animal-derived sources in the diet, particularly for individuals at risk of deficiency.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 687, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
