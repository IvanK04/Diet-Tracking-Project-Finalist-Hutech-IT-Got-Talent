It is essential for maintaining cellular functions and supporting metabolic processes throughout the body. Found in a wide variety of foods, NIACIN is present in animal-based sources such as whole chicken, fish, and pork ears, as well as plant-based foods including artichokes, strawberries, dill, red chili peppers, and ridge gourd. Its presence in these diverse food sources underscores its broad dietary availability. Beyond energy production, NIACIN contributes to DNA repair mechanisms, helping to maintain genomic stability and cellular integrity. Additionally, it supports skin health, making it beneficial for skin integrity and overall dermatological well-being. While it is commonly associated with animal-based foods, its occurrence in plant-based sources such as artichokes, dill, and certain vegetables highlights its versatility across different dietary patterns. The consistent emphasis across multiple descriptions on NIACIN’s roles in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and skin health confirms these as its primary biological functions. Although some descriptions mention specific food sources with varying levels of detail, there are no contradictory claims regarding its functions or sources—rather, they reinforce the vitamin’s wide-ranging benefits and dietary distribution. The inclusion of both animal and plant-based sources reflects its accessibility and importance in a balanced diet. As a component of the B-complex vitamins, NIACIN supports overall metabolic health and is vital for normal physiological function. Its presence in both common and less conventional foods indicates that it can be obtained through varied dietary choices. In summary, NIACIN is a vital B vitamin essential for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and skin health, found in a diverse range of foods including animal products and various plant-based sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 379, "total_tokens": 745, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
