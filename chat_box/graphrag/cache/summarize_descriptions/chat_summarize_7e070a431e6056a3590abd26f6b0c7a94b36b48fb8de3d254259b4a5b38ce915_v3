It is widely distributed across a variety of plant-based foods, including clementines, garlic, onions, bell peppers, almonds, water spinach, lotus root, Dao fruits, and plantain. These sources contribute to the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress and maintain overall health. Vitamin C plays a key role in several essential physiological processes, such as collagen synthesis, which is crucial for skin, blood vessel, and bone health, and enhances iron absorption, particularly from non-heme sources in plant-based diets. Its presence in both fruits and vegetables underscores its broad dietary availability. While some sources, like garlic and onions, are less commonly associated with high vitamin C content, scientific evidence confirms that bell peppers and water spinach are particularly rich in this nutrient. Almonds and lotus root also provide notable amounts, supporting immune health and antioxidant activity. Additionally, fruits such as Dao and plantain are recognized as sources of vitamin C, further expanding the range of dietary options. Although the initial mention of garlic as a source of vitamin C is less substantiated compared to other listed foods, the overall consensus across the descriptions supports vitamin C’s presence in a diverse array of plant foods. The nutrient’s importance in immune support and its role in maintaining cellular health make it a key component of a balanced diet. Despite minor discrepancies in specific food associations, all descriptions converge on vitamin C’s fundamental functions and its widespread occurrence in common dietary items. Therefore, Vitamin C is best understood as a versatile, essential nutrient found in a broad spectrum of fruits and vegetables, contributing significantly to immune function, antioxidant defense, and metabolic health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 645, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
