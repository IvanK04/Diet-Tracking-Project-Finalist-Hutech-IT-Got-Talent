This nutrient is naturally present in significant concentrations within the yolk, making it a valuable dietary contributor to these physiological processes. The presence of vitamin A in egg yolk aligns with its well-documented benefits for eye health, particularly in maintaining proper night vision, and for bolstering the body’s immune defenses against infections. Both descriptions provided emphasize the same core relationship—egg yolk contains vitamin A, which supports vision and immune function—confirming consistency in the information. There are no contradictory elements between the descriptions, as they both highlight the same nutritional and functional benefits of vitamin A derived from egg yolk. Therefore, the summary is unified and coherent, reflecting the established scientific understanding of this nutrient’s role in human health. The synergy between the egg yolk and vitamin A underscores the importance of including this food component in balanced diets, especially for individuals requiring enhanced vision or immune support. Overall, egg yolk serves not only as a source of dietary fat and protein but also as a bioavailable provider of essential vitamins, with vitamin A being a key example. This makes it a nutritionally significant part of a healthy diet. The information confirms that vitamin A in egg yolk is both present in high concentration and functionally beneficial, reinforcing its value in nutritional science and everyday dietary planning.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
