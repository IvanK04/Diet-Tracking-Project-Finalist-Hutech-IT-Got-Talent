It is well known as a common allergen and can trigger adverse immune responses in individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. In such cases, consuming gluten can lead to inflammation, digestive issues, and long-term health complications. However, not all grains contain gluten; for example, sticky rice is explicitly gluten-free and is therefore suitable for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Additionally, the fermentation process used in sourdough bread helps break down gluten molecules, which may improve digestibility for some people, particularly those with mild gluten sensitivities. This partial breakdown can reduce the negative effects of gluten in certain contexts, though it does not eliminate the risk for those with celiac disease. Despite these variations in processing and grain sources, gluten remains a key allergen in the food industry, and its presence must be carefully monitored in food labeling and dietary planning. While gluten is essential in many baked goods and processed foods for structure and texture, its health implications necessitate careful consideration, especially for sensitive individuals. The distinction between gluten-containing and gluten-free grains—such as the gluten-free nature of sticky rice—highlights the importance of reading food labels and understanding ingredient sources. Overall, gluten is a complex protein with both functional and health-related implications, and its role in food varies significantly depending on the grain, processing method, and individual health conditions. For those with gluten-related disorders, avoiding gluten is critical, while others may tolerate it, especially when consumed in fermented forms like sourdough. Thus, while gluten is a fundamental component of many staple foods, its presence and impact must be understood in context.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 367, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 619, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
