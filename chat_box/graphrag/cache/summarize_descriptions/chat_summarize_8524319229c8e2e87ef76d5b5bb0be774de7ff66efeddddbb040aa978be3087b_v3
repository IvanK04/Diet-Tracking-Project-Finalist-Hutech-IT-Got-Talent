It is a lean source of high-quality protein and is low in calories, making it a nutritious option for those seeking dietary protein with minimal fat. The organ is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, and the B complex—specifically biotin, niacin, thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B12, and selenium—contributing to overall health and bodily functions. Due to its dense structure, chicken gizzard requires prolonged cooking methods such as stewing or braising to become tender and palatable. It is commonly incorporated into traditional dishes, particularly in soups and stir-fries, where it is believed to help clear heat from the body, a practice rooted in traditional culinary and medicinal systems. While raw chicken gizzard is occasionally consumed in certain traditional preparations and is noted for its high protein content and absence of carbohydrates, it is generally not recommended for raw consumption due to potential food safety risks. The organ's nutritional profile supports its use as a dietary source of essential nutrients, especially in cultures where traditional meat-based dishes emphasize organ meats. Despite variations in preparation, the consistent attributes of chicken gizzard—its protein density, mineral richness, and role in traditional cuisine—highlight its value as a functional and nutritious food component. Overall, chicken gizzard serves as both a culinary ingredient and a nutritional resource, valued for its unique texture and health benefits when properly prepared.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 608, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
