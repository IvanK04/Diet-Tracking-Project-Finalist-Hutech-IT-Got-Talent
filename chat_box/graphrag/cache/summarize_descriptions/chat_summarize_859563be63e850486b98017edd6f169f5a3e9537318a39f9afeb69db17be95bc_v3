Found in a wide variety of foods including spinach, peanut butter, pork belly, shallots, fish, seeds, kumquats, and white sugar, potassium contributes to the body’s electrolyte balance and overall physiological stability. Its functions extend beyond basic homeostasis, as it is vital for transmitting nerve signals and enabling proper muscle activity, including the heart. While the presence of potassium in foods such as white sugar may be less commonly emphasized, scientific evidence confirms its role in metabolic processes and physiological regulation. The consistent mention across multiple sources—spanning plant-based foods like spinach and kumquats, animal-based sources like pork belly and fish, and even processed items like peanut butter and white sugar—demonstrates the broad dietary availability of this mineral. Despite some variations in specific food sources cited, the core functions of potassium remain unified: maintaining fluid balance, supporting nerve transmission, regulating blood pressure, and ensuring proper muscle function. These roles are fundamental to cardiovascular health, cellular communication, and overall metabolic efficiency. Although the inclusion of white sugar as a source of potassium may raise questions about its nutritional value, it is accurate that trace amounts of potassium are present in such foods, though they are not a significant or recommended source. The primary dietary sources of potassium are nutrient-dense foods such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds, legumes, and certain fruits and meats. The mineral’s importance in preventing hypertension and supporting electrolyte equilibrium underscores its value in a balanced diet. Contradictions in the descriptions—such as the inclusion of white sugar or pork belly as primary sources—are resolved by recognizing that while these foods contain small amounts of potassium, they are not primary or optimal sources. The consistent scientific consensus across all descriptions emphasizes potassium’s central role in physiological regulation, with no conflicting claims about its functions. Therefore, the comprehensive summary of potassium highlights its essential biological functions and widespread presence in diverse food groups, reinforcing its status as a vital nutrient for human health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 693, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
