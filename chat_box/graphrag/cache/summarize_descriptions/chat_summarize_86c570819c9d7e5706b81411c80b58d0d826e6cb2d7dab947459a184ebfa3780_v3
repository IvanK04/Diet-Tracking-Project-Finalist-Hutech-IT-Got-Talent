This high-protein meal offers a balanced profile of essential nutrients, including 16.5 grams of protein per serving, 8.1 milligrams of iron, and 996 micrograms of vitamin A, supporting overall bodily health, immune function, and vision. The dish is particularly beneficial for individuals seeking protein-rich, nutrient-dense meals and daily dietary variety. Its distinct flavor profile arises from the rich, savory base of chicken offal and the fresh, herbaceous notes of lemongrass, which enhance both taste and aroma. While some descriptions refer to pork liver, the primary and consistent ingredient in the culinary context is chicken offal, making pork liver an inaccuracy. The inclusion of bitter melon and water spinach adds a refreshing, slightly bitter contrast that complements the richness of the meat components. LÒNG GÀ XÀO MƯẾP is not only a source of high-quality protein but also a valuable contributor to dietary diversity, offering a well-rounded mix of vitamins and minerals. It is especially suitable for health-conscious individuals and those looking to incorporate more plant-based and animal-based nutrients into their daily meals. The dish is commonly prepared in Vietnamese cuisine and reflects traditional methods of combining animal offal with seasonal vegetables to create flavorful, balanced meals. Despite variations in ingredient emphasis across sources, the core composition remains centered on chicken offal and vegetables, with no credible evidence supporting the inclusion of pork liver. Therefore, the accurate and coherent description of LÒNG GÀ XÀO MƯẾP emphasizes its nutritional value, flavor profile, and role in a healthy, balanced diet. This dish stands out as both a culinary and nutritional highlight in Vietnamese home cooking.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
