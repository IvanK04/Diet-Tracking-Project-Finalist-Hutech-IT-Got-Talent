It is naturally derived from beta-carotene, a precursor found in a variety of plant-based foods such as carrots, pumpkins, mandarin oranges, kale, red beets, and watercress. When these foods are cooked, beta-carotene is more readily released and converted into active vitamin A, enhancing its bioavailability. This nutrient is also present in animal-based sources, including pork liver, chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, beef, and duck, where it is found in higher concentrations and is readily absorbed. Specific dishes such as roasted duck and pork liver sautéed with watercress, gan gà (goat liver), gan xào giá (fried liver), and thịt bò xào rau muống (beef stir-fried with water spinach) highlight vitamin A as a key health benefit. Additionally, Vietnamese Balm, a traditional herb-based food, contains vitamin A, contributing to overall wellness. While the nutrient is present in various forms across different foods, its primary roles remain consistent: supporting healthy vision, strengthening the immune system, and promoting skin integrity. The presence of vitamin A in both plant and animal sources underscores its broad dietary availability and importance in maintaining optimal health. Although some descriptions mention specific foods with high concentrations, such as gan gà and pork liver, the overarching theme across all sources is the consistent contribution of vitamin A to vision, immunity, and skin health. Contradictions in food sources are resolved by recognizing that vitamin A is found in diverse foods—both plant-based (carrots, beets, oranges, kale) and animal-based (liver, beef, chicken organs)—with varying levels of concentration. The nutrient's role in health is universally acknowledged, and its dietary sources are both varied and accessible, making it a cornerstone of balanced nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 465, "total_tokens": 847, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
