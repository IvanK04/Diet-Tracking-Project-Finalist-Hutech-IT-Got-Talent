Selenium functions as a powerful antioxidant, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body and reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to various chronic diseases. In addition to its antioxidant properties, selenium supports immune function by enhancing the body’s ability to defend against infections and pathogens. It also plays a critical role in thyroid health, where it is a key component of enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones. Proper thyroid function is essential for regulating metabolism, energy levels, and overall physiological balance. The presence of selenium in salmon contributes to its status as a health-promoting food, particularly for individuals seeking to support their immune and endocrine systems. While the exact concentration of selenium can vary depending on the salmon’s diet and environment, it remains consistently present in significant amounts, making salmon a valuable dietary source. The synergy between selenium and other nutrients in salmon—such as omega-3 fatty acids and high-quality protein—further amplifies its health benefits. Overall, selenium in salmon not only protects cells from damage but also ensures optimal functioning of vital bodily systems, including the immune and thyroid glands. This makes salmon a particularly beneficial food for maintaining long-term health and wellness. The dual role of selenium—both as an antioxidant and a cofactor in thyroid hormone production—highlights its importance in nutritional science. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions; both emphasize selenium’s antioxidant and immune-supportive properties, with one additionally noting its role in thyroid function. These points are consistent and complementary, reinforcing the comprehensive health benefits of selenium in salmon. Therefore, the final summary reflects a unified and coherent understanding of the nutritional value of selenium in salmon.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
