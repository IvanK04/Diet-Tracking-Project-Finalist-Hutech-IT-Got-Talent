It plays a central role in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a vital molecule involved in numerous metabolic processes. Coenzyme A is critical for fatty acid synthesis, energy metabolism, and the production of hormones, making pantothenic acid indispensable for maintaining metabolic balance. The vitamin is widely distributed in a variety of dietary sources, including meats such as pork chop and chicken wings, as well as vegetables like green peas, green cabbage, cucumber, tomato, garlic, and mushrooms. It is also found in plant-based foods such as galangal and fish, indicating its broad availability across both animal and plant-based diets. This widespread presence in diverse foods ensures that adequate intake is generally achievable through a balanced diet. Pantothenic acid is particularly important for energy metabolism, where it supports the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to generate cellular energy. Additionally, it contributes to the synthesis of fatty acids and certain hormones, further underscoring its role in physiological regulation. While some descriptions emphasize its involvement in fatty acid metabolism, others highlight its role in energy metabolism and hormone synthesis—these functions are not mutually exclusive, as coenzyme A serves as a common link in both pathways. The consistent theme across all descriptions is that pantothenic acid is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A and is deeply involved in energy production and metabolic processes. Despite minor variations in the specific food sources mentioned, all descriptions converge on the core biological functions and dietary prevalence of the vitamin. There are no contradictory claims; rather, the information reinforces the vitamin’s fundamental role in cellular metabolism. Pantothenic acid is present in a wide range of commonly consumed foods, from everyday vegetables to animal products, which supports its accessibility and importance in nutritional science. Its universal presence in both plant and animal foods suggests that deficiency is rare in typical diets. Overall, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a foundational nutrient that supports energy metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and hormone production through its role in coenzyme A formation. Its broad dietary sources and essential biological functions make it a key component of metabolic health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 437, "total_tokens": 888, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
