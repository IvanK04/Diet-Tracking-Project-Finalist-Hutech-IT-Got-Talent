This energy level is considered appropriate for balanced daily intake, supporting stable energy levels throughout the day without placing an excessive burden on the body. The tag reflects a moderate caloric content, making it suitable for individuals seeking to maintain a balanced diet without overconsumption of energy. It is designed to align with general dietary guidelines that promote sustained physical and mental performance while avoiding excessive caloric intake. The term \"moderate energy\" is consistently applied across both nutritional and health contexts, emphasizing a balanced approach to energy provision. This tag is particularly useful in meal planning and dietary assessments, where maintaining energy equilibrium is essential for overall well-being. It does not imply any specific macronutrient composition but rather a general measure of total energy (calories) per serving. MODERATE_ENERGY is intended to support healthy lifestyle choices by offering a reliable indicator of energy density, helping consumers make informed decisions about their food intake. It is not associated with any specific health condition or restriction, but rather serves as a general descriptor of energy level. The consistency between the descriptions—focusing on balanced daily intake and avoiding excessive energy load or caloric consumption—confirms the coherence of the tag. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the same core concept: moderate energy content supports balanced nutrition without overconsumption. Therefore, MODERATE_ENERGY functions as a clear, standardized health indicator for foods that provide a sustainable and appropriate amount of energy for everyday needs. This makes it a valuable tool in nutritional labeling, dietary recommendations, and wellness applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
