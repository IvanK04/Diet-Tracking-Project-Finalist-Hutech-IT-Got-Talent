It plays a critical role in maintaining proper neurological function and supporting the production of healthy red blood cells, which are necessary for oxygen transport throughout the body. Found primarily in animal-based foods, Vitamin B12 is commonly present in fish such as salmon and catfish fillet, as well as in other animal products. While some descriptions incorrectly list plant-based foods like pears and mangosteen as sources of Vitamin B12, this is scientifically inaccurate—Vitamin B12 is not naturally present in plant foods and is not synthesized by plants. The claim that it is found in pears or mangosteen appears to be a factual error, possibly due to a translation or data input mistake. The Vietnamese description, \"Vitamin B12 là một vitamin B, có mặt trong dồi huyết, hỗ trợ chức năng thần kinh và sản xuất hồng cầu,\" correctly identifies its presence in blood-rich animal products and its role in nervous system function and red blood cell production, aligning with the scientific consensus. Therefore, the accurate and comprehensive summary is that Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin crucial for neurological health, hematopoiesis, and energy metabolism. It is naturally found in animal-derived foods such as salmon, catfish, and other fish, and is not present in significant amounts in plant-based foods like pears or mangosteen. The nutrient is essential for preventing deficiencies that can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and cognitive decline. Despite some misleading references in the provided data, the consistent scientific evidence confirms that Vitamin B12 is derived from animal sources and is indispensable for human health. Its primary functions include supporting the formation of red blood cells, maintaining the integrity of the nervous system, and facilitating cellular energy production. In conclusion, Vitamin B12 is a critical micronutrient best obtained through dietary sources such as fish, meat, dairy, and eggs, and its absence in plant foods underscores the importance of including animal-based foods in a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 728, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
