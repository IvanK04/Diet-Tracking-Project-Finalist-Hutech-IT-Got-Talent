It plays a critical role in fetal development and is particularly important during pregnancy. This B-vitamin is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including leafy greens such as kale and spinach, green peas, mushrooms, green cabbage, and citrus fruits. It is also found in vegetables like cucumber, tomato, leek, and sweet basil, as well as in meats such as chicken wings and chicken breast. Additionally, FOLATE_DFE is present in plant-based foods including amaranth, edamame, garlic, and galangal. It supports overall cellular health, red blood cell formation, and proper development during pregnancy. The presence of FOLATE_DFE in foods like cinnamon and lemon further underscores its broad dietary availability. While the vitamin is commonly associated with cell division and DNA synthesis, its importance in fetal development is consistently emphasized across multiple sources. Although some descriptions mention specific foods such as grouper, the evidence for this source is less consistent and not corroborated by the majority of the data. Therefore, the primary dietary sources of FOLATE_DFE are considered to be plant-based and animal-based foods rich in folate, including leafy greens, legumes, vegetables, and certain meats. The term \"DFE\" (Dietary Folate Equivalents) reflects the standardized way of measuring folate intake, accounting for different forms of folate in food. All provided descriptions converge on the core functions of FOLATE_DFE—supporting DNA synthesis, cell division, and fetal development—while highlighting its presence in diverse food groups. Contradictions, such as the mention of grouper or specific references to galangal without consistent support, are resolved by focusing on the most frequently and reliably cited sources. Ultimately, FOLATE_DFE is a vital nutrient for human health, especially during periods of rapid cell growth and development, and is accessible through a wide range of commonly consumed foods. Its role in maintaining healthy cellular function and supporting maternal and fetal well-being makes it a key component of balanced nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 489, "total_tokens": 929, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
