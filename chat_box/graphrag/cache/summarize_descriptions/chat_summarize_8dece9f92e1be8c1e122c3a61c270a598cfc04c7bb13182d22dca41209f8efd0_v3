Despite its common name \"glutinous rice,\" it contains no gluten and is primarily composed of starch with minimal fat, making it a unique grain in terms of both texture and composition. It is widely used across various Asian cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it plays a central role in traditional dishes, both savory and sweet. In Chinese culinary traditions, Sticky Rice is often served in its pure form or lightly seasoned, functioning as a side dish or as a key ingredient in a variety of recipes. It is especially valued in desserts, such as sticky rice pudding, where its natural sweetness enhances the flavor profile, and in savory preparations like rice-based curries or fillings. The rice's high starch content contributes to its cohesive texture, which holds together well during cooking and is ideal for dishes that require binding or shaping. While it is commonly associated with Southeast Asian cuisine, its presence in Chinese culinary practices highlights its broader regional significance. Sticky Rice is not only a staple food in many households but also a cultural symbol in traditional celebrations and festive meals. Its versatility allows it to be adapted in both home cooking and professional kitchens, making it a foundational ingredient in the culinary heritage of Asia. Although some may confuse its name with gluten-containing grains, Sticky Rice is entirely gluten-free, making it a suitable option for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Overall, Sticky Rice stands out as a versatile, culturally significant, and texturally unique rice variety that bridges both sweet and savory culinary traditions across Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 328, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 597, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
