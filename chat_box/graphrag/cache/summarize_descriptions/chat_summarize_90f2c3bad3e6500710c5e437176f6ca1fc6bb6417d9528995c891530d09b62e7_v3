It is commonly found in food, particularly in salt, processed foods, and certain natural sources such as fish sauce, pork belly, shallots, spinach, kumquats, and white sugar. In spinach, sodium is present in small amounts (1–2% by weight), while in dishes like thịt lợn xá xíu and thịt bò khô, it is present in high concentrations, often described as \"nhiều natri\" (high sodium). This high sodium content is a significant health concern, as excessive intake is linked to elevated blood pressure, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and poor heart health. Additionally, high sodium consumption is considered unsuitable for individuals with diabetes. Although sodium plays a vital role in flavor enhancement and acts as a natural preservative in food products, its overconsumption poses notable health risks. The mineral is distributed across both processed and natural foods, with processed items such as fish sauce and cured meats being particularly high in sodium. While sodium is necessary for physiological functions such as fluid regulation and nerve signaling, dietary guidelines emphasize moderation due to its association with chronic health conditions. The presence of sodium in common ingredients like pork belly and shallots further underscores its widespread use in culinary practices, especially in traditional dishes. Despite its natural occurrence in small quantities in certain vegetables and fruits, the overall dietary intake—particularly in processed and preserved foods—can exceed recommended levels. Therefore, while sodium is a fundamental nutrient required for bodily functions, its consumption must be carefully managed to avoid adverse health outcomes. This balance between physiological necessity and health risk highlights the importance of mindful food choices, especially in diets rich in processed or preserved items. In summary, sodium is a vital mineral found across a wide range of foods, essential for bodily functions, yet its high intake in certain dishes poses significant health risks, making it a key focus in nutritional guidance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 521, "total_tokens": 917, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
