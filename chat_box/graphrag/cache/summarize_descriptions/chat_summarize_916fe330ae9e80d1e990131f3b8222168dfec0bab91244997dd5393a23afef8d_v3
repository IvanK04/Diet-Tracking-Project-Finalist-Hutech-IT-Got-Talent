It plays a critical role in maintaining proper blood coagulation and supporting bone health by facilitating the synthesis of proteins involved in these processes. While commonly associated with leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale, Vitamin K is also found in a variety of other foods, including pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and ngò rí. These dietary sources contribute to the body’s daily requirement of the vitamin. Importantly, the body can also produce small amounts of Vitamin K, primarily in the intestines through the action of gut bacteria, supplementing dietary intake. Although some descriptions mention its presence in fruits and vegetables like pears and mangosteen, the most consistent and scientifically supported sources are leafy greens, which remain the primary dietary contributors. The inclusion of foods such as sticky rice and ngò rí highlights the vitamin’s broader dietary distribution, though these sources are generally considered less significant than leafy greens in terms of concentration and bioavailability. Despite minor variations in the list of food sources, all descriptions converge on the core functions of Vitamin K—supporting blood clotting and bone metabolism. Contradictions in the sources (e.g., pears and mangosteen being highlighted in multiple entries) are resolved by recognizing that while these foods may contain trace amounts of Vitamin K, they are not primary or most reliable sources. The most accurate and comprehensive summary, therefore, emphasizes the vitamin’s essential physiological roles and its primary dietary sources in leafy green vegetables, with supplementary contributions from certain fruits, grains, and herbs. Overall, Vitamin K is a vital nutrient that supports both cardiovascular and skeletal health, with its benefits derived from a combination of dietary intake and endogenous production.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 663, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
