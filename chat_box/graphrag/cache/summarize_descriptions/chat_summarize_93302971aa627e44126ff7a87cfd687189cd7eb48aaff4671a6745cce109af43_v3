It is naturally sweet and rich in essential nutrients, including vitamins A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex vitamins, as well as key minerals such as iron, potassium, and magnesium. With a moderate calorie count and low fat content, grape offers a fiber-rich, low-sodium dietary option, making it a nutritious choice when consumed fresh or processed. The fruit is particularly noted for its high concentration of antioxidants, including flavonoids and resveratrol—especially in red and purple varieties—which have been associated with cardiovascular health benefits. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, contributes to the protective effects of grapes against oxidative stress and inflammation, further enhancing their health-promoting properties. GRAPE is commonly consumed in various forms, including fresh, dried, in juice, or as a component in wine production. Its versatility in culinary and beverage applications underscores its widespread use across global diets. While all grape varieties share a similar nutritional profile, the red and purple types stand out due to their elevated levels of resveratrol, which may offer additional health advantages. The fruit's natural composition supports overall wellness, providing a balanced mix of vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds. Despite some variations in flavor and skin color, the core nutritional and health benefits remain consistent across different grape types. GRAPE is not only a delicious and widely available fruit but also a valuable contributor to a healthy, balanced diet due to its antioxidant content and low-fat, high-fiber structure. Its role in both daily nutrition and traditional food products highlights its importance in both modern and historical food systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 713, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
