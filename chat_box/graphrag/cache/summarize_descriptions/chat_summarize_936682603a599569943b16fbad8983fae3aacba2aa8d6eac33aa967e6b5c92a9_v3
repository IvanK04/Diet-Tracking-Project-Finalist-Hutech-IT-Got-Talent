The dish contains approximately 623 calories, 19.9 grams of protein, 86.6 grams of carbohydrates, and 21.9 grams of fat, with notable levels of iron, calcium, and potassium, which support overall nutritional needs.\n\nDespite its nutritional benefits, CƠM RANG THẬP CẨM is also classified as high in cholesterol, saturated fat, and sodium, which raises concerns for individuals managing cardiovascular health or those with diabetes. Due to its high fat and sodium content, it is not recommended for people with heart conditions or those on diabetic diets.

It is rich in essential minerals like iron and calcium, which support blood health and bone strength, and its high carbohydrate content provides sustained energy. The inclusion of vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, and sweet corn contributes to dietary fiber and a variety of vitamins, while the protein from pork sausage and duck eggs supports muscle development.\n\nAlthough some descriptions highlight the dish as high in iron and calcium, others emphasize its high fat and cholesterol levels, indicating a nutritional profile that is both beneficial and potentially risky depending on individual health conditions. The presence of both high-protein and high-carb components aligns with its role as a weight-gain meal, though this benefit must be balanced against its negative impacts on heart health and blood sugar regulation.\n\nIn summary, CƠM RANG THẬP CẨM is a popular, nutrient-dense Vietnamese dish that offers substantial energy and protein, ideal for weight gain and general sustenance. However, due to its high fat, cholesterol, and sodium content, it should be consumed in moderation, especially by individuals with heart disease, diabetes, or food allergies. The dish is safe for those with gluten or dairy sensitivities but requires careful consideration for those with specific dietary restrictions.
