It is widely recognized for its high protein content, beneficial monounsaturated fats that support heart health, and dietary fiber, making it a nutritious addition to various diets. Naturally gluten-free, peanut butter is a sustainable and natural source of energy, ideal for those seeking wholesome, plant-based nutrition. It is commonly available in two forms: smooth and crunchy, with natural varieties containing only peanuts and salt, emphasizing minimal processing and ingredient transparency. In contrast, commercial versions may include added sugars, hydrogenated oils, or other additives, which can affect its nutritional profile and overall health benefits. Despite its nutritional advantages, peanut butter is one of the most common food allergens, and individuals with peanut allergies must exercise extreme caution when consuming it or when it is present in food products. This allergenic nature necessitates careful labeling and awareness, particularly in schools, restaurants, and households with allergic individuals. While peanut butter is often praised for its health benefits, its widespread use in processed foods and snacks can sometimes compromise its natural qualities. Therefore, consumers are encouraged to choose natural, minimally processed options to maximize nutritional value and minimize potential health risks. Overall, peanut butter remains a versatile and valuable food item, offering both culinary utility and health benefits when selected wisely. Its status as a staple in many diets underscores its importance in nutrition, though awareness of its allergenic properties and ingredient variability is essential for safe and informed consumption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 599, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
