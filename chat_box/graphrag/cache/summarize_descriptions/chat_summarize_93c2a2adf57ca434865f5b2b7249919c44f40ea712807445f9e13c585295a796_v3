It is naturally found in a variety of foods, including soybeans, chicken breast, asparagus, walnuts, and gan gà (a type of chicken), making it widely available across both animal and plant-based diets. Folate is especially beneficial in plant-based diets, where it supports overall cellular health and development. Its presence in diverse food sources ensures that individuals following various dietary patterns can meet their daily requirements. The nutrient is commonly associated with health tags such as 'giàu_folate', underscoring its importance in promoting well-being and supporting reproductive and developmental processes. While some descriptions note high concentrations in specific animal products like gan gà, the overall evidence indicates that folate is broadly distributed across both plant and animal sources. This widespread availability supports its role in maintaining healthy cell function and development, particularly during critical life stages such as pregnancy. Despite minor variations in the specific food sources cited—such as chicken breast, gan gà, and walnuts—the core functions of folate remain consistent across all references: supporting DNA synthesis, cell division, and fetal development. There are no contradictory claims regarding folate’s biological functions or dietary sources; rather, the descriptions complement each other by highlighting its presence in different food groups. The emphasis on its importance in pregnancy and cellular health aligns with established nutritional science. Therefore, Folate is recognized as a vital micronutrient that contributes to overall health, with benefits extending from general cellular maintenance to specialized developmental needs. Its presence in both plant and animal foods ensures accessibility and supports diverse dietary choices. In summary, Folate is a foundational B-vitamin that supports essential biological processes, particularly in growing and developing organisms, and is a key component of balanced, health-promoting diets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 620, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
