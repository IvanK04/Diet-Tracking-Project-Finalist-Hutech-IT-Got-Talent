It is rich in polyphenols and vitamin E, contributing to its high antioxidant content. These compounds are associated with a range of health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties and support for cardiovascular health. The presence of polyphenols, particularly oleocanthal and oleuropein, has been linked to reduced inflammation and improved cholesterol levels, which may lower the risk of heart disease. Olive oil is widely recognized for its role in promoting overall well-being and is a staple in Mediterranean diets. Its nutritional profile makes it a valuable component in both culinary and health-focused applications. While traditionally used in cooking, it is also consumed in raw forms, such as in salad dressings, to maximize the intake of beneficial compounds. The cold-pressing method ensures minimal heat exposure, preserving the oil’s natural compounds and enhancing its health-promoting qualities. Overall, olive oil stands out as a nutritious, versatile, and health-supportive ingredient in modern nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
