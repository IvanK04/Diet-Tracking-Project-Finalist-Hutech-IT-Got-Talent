It plays a critical role in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and immune function, contributing to brain development and overall brain health. VITAMIN_B6 is particularly important for the formation of red blood cells, supporting hematopoiesis and oxygen transport in the body. Found in a variety of dietary sources including bơ tươi (fresh coconut), black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, and carp, this vitamin is widely distributed across plant and animal-based foods. Its involvement in the synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA underscores its significance in maintaining mental well-being and cognitive function. Additionally, VITAMIN_B6 supports immune system regulation, helping the body defend against infections. While the specific sources listed vary slightly—such as bơ tươi, black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, and carp—these reflect a broad dietary range where the vitamin is accessible. The consistent emphasis across all descriptions highlights its central role in neurological and metabolic processes, as well as in maintaining healthy red blood cell production. Although some descriptions mention specific foods like carp or bean sprouts, the overarching function of VITAMIN_B6 remains unified: it is a vital nutrient that supports brain development, cognitive function, immune health, and metabolic balance. No contradictions are present in the provided descriptions, as all align around the core biological roles and dietary sources of VITAMIN_B6. The information collectively confirms that VITAMIN_B6 is not only essential for basic metabolic functions but also a key player in neurological and immune health, making it a fundamental component of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 691, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
