A defining element of this cuisine is the widespread use of dark soy sauce, which adds both depth and a rich, amber hue to a variety of dishes, including stir-fries, braised meats, and marinades. This sauce contributes not only to the visual appeal but also enhances the umami flavor profile, making it a staple in many classic recipes. In addition to soy sauce, Chinese cuisine often incorporates sticky rice as a side dish or key ingredient, used in both savory and sweet preparations. Sticky rice provides a comforting, chewy texture and is commonly found in dishes such as rice noodle bowls, dumplings, and desserts like red bean or glutinous rice cakes.
