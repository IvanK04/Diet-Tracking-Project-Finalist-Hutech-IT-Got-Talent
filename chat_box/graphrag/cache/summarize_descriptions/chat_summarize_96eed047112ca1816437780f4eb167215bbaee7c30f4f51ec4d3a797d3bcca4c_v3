It functions as a cofactor for key antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, which helps neutralize oxidative stress and protect cells from damage. Selenium contributes to the maintenance of thyroid hormone metabolism, ensuring proper regulation of metabolism, growth, and development. Its presence in a wide variety of dietary sources makes it accessible through a balanced diet. Found in seafood such as fish fillets, salmon, and cá rô, selenium supports cellular protection and overall health. It is also present in plant-based foods including garlic, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, leafy greens like kale and green cabbage, and various fruits such as papaya, lemon, and mango. Additional sources include meat products like pork liver, pork stomach, and pork intestine, as well as legumes, beans, and whole grains. Notably, selenium is also found in less conventional sources such as coconut, cucumber, tomato, and even sunflower oil. While some descriptions mention its presence in foods like cinnamon, galangal, and amaranth, the consistent theme across all references is its role as a vital antioxidant and regulator of thyroid and immune function. Although the specific food sources vary slightly, the overarching consensus is that selenium is widely distributed in both animal and plant-based diets. The mineral's importance in preventing oxidative damage and supporting immune defense underscores its significance in nutritional wellness. Despite minor inconsistencies in the list—such as the omission of certain foods or redundant mentions—no contradictory claims are presented regarding selenium’s biological functions. All descriptions align in affirming its role as a key nutrient for antioxidant defense, thyroid health, and immune support. Therefore, selenium stands out as a versatile and essential trace mineral, contributing to overall health through its presence in diverse dietary components. Its broad dietary availability ensures that individuals can obtain adequate selenium through a varied and balanced diet, making it a cornerstone of nutritional science.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 404, "prompt_tokens": 656, "total_tokens": 1060, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
