It is commonly found in fish such as cod and tilapia, as well as in other seafood like salmon and trout, and is also present in certain animal-based products and supplements. The vitamin plays a critical role in maintaining healthy blood formation, supporting nerve function, and facilitating energy metabolism. While some descriptions note its presence in specific dishes such as \"ca thu chen\" and \"ca tre chen\" (which translate to cod and tilapia in Vietnamese), these references confirm its dietary availability in commonly consumed fish preparations. Although one description briefly mentions Vitamin B12 in the context of tags without detailed elaboration, this does not diminish its established biological and nutritional significance. The consistent references across multiple sources—spanning both Vietnamese and English descriptions—highlight its presence in fish and its key physiological functions. Contradictions in the descriptions are minimal and primarily stem from varying levels of detail or contextual framing, such as the absence of explicit functional details in one entry. These inconsistencies are resolved by synthesizing the core scientific and dietary information, which all converge on Vitamin B12’s role in blood and nerve health. The nutrient is particularly important for individuals with dietary restrictions or deficiencies, as it is not naturally produced by the human body and must be obtained through diet or supplementation. Overall, Vitamin B12 stands out as a crucial micronutrient, especially in diets rich in marine sources, contributing significantly to overall health and metabolic balance. Its presence in fish like cod and tilapia, combined with its well-documented functions in cellular and neurological processes, underscores its importance in both nutritional science and everyday dietary planning.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
