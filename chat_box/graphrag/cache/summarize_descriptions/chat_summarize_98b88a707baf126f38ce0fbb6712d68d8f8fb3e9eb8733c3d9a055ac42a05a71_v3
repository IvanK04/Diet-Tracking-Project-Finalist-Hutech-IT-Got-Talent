This category encompasses a variety of traditional and modern dishes, including chè thập cẩm (a mixed herbal tea dessert), caramen hoa quả tươi (fresh fruit caramel), and kem sữa chua trân châu (yogurt with jelly balls and coconut milk). These dishes are typically served at the end of a meal to provide a balanced and enjoyable conclusion to the dining experience. While some descriptions initially suggest that Tráng miệng may include savory or non-sweet options, the consistent emphasis across the provided information confirms that it is primarily focused on sweet, dessert-like items. The term is often used in Vietnamese culinary contexts to denote light, refreshing, and flavorful sweet offerings that complement the richness of a main dish. Examples such as sweetened yogurt with jelly balls and coconut milk highlight the emphasis on texture and sweetness, with ingredients like fruit, dairy, and gelatinous elements contributing to the overall appeal. The variety within Tráng miệng reflects both traditional Vietnamese tastes and contemporary adaptations, making it a versatile and popular component of meals. Despite minor variations in phrasing, there is no contradiction in the descriptions—each reinforces the idea that Tráng miệng is a sweet, post-meal category designed to refresh the palate. It is not a savory or general snack category, but specifically a dessert-oriented tradition rooted in Vietnamese culinary culture. The inclusion of both traditional elements like chè and modern creations like fruit caramel and yogurt with trân châu demonstrates its adaptability and enduring popularity. Overall, TRÁNG MIỆNG plays a significant role in Vietnamese dining by offering a harmonious, sweet finish to a meal, enhancing both flavor and cultural experience.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 669, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
