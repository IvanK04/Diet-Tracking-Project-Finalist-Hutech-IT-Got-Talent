It serves as a key ingredient in popular dishes such as chè thái and various sweet preparations involving fruit and pearls. SỮA is commonly incorporated into traditional recipes to provide a creamy texture and rich flavor, contributing to the distinctive taste profiles of these cultural treats. However, it is also recognized as a common allergen in certain food items, including chè thái, caramel fruit desserts, and yogurt with pearls. This allergenic property necessitates caution for individuals with dairy sensitivities or allergies, making it important for consumers to be aware of its presence in these dishes. Despite its widespread use in traditional food preparation, the allergenic nature of SỮA highlights the need for clear labeling and awareness in both home cooking and commercial food service settings. The dual role of SỮA—being both a foundational component of Vietnamese culinary heritage and a potential allergen—underscores its significance in both cultural and health-related contexts. While it enhances the sensory appeal of many traditional sweets, its presence in specific recipes requires careful consideration for dietary restrictions. Overall, SỮA remains a central element in Vietnamese dessert culture, valued for its flavor and texture, yet its allergenic properties demand mindful inclusion in food preparation and consumption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
