It contributes a distinct nutty flavor and enhances the texture and taste of several culinary preparations, including Goi ngó sen, Nộm tai heo thập cẩm, Nộm bò khô, chè vừng đen, and chè kem dừa. In Goi ngó sen, lạc rang adds both flavor and a notable allergen component, particularly for individuals with peanut allergies. Similarly, in desserts like chè vừng đen and chè kem dừa, roasted peanuts serve as a source of protein and fat, enriching the dish’s nutritional profile. Its presence in Vietnamese-style salads, such as Nộm tai heo thập cẩm and Nộm bò khô, underscores its role not only as a flavor enhancer but also as a contributor of healthy fats. Despite its culinary value, lạc rang is recognized as a common allergen, making it important for individuals with peanut sensitivities to be cautious when consuming these dishes. The ingredient is consistently valued for its ability to balance the dish’s texture and provide a rich, savory note. While some descriptions emphasize its nutritional benefits, such as protein and healthy fat content, the overarching theme across all contexts is its dual role: a key flavoring agent and a potential allergen. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all align in identifying lạc rang as a central component in both savory and sweet Vietnamese cuisine. Its use spans across diverse food categories, reflecting its versatility and cultural significance. Overall, lạc rang remains a fundamental element in traditional Vietnamese cooking, valued for its taste, texture, and nutritional contribution—though its allergenic nature necessitates awareness among consumers with peanut allergies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 713, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
