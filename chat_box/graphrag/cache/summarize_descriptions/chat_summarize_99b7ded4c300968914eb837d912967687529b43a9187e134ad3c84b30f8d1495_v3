Their high antioxidant content supports overall wellness, while their rich vitamin profile—especially vitamin K, which plays a key role in blood clotting and bone health—makes them a valuable addition to a balanced diet. Despite minor discrepancies in flavor description, the consensus across sources supports their status as a nutrient-dense, versatile leafy green. The plant's culinary use is well-established in both traditional and modern cooking, particularly in regions where root vegetables are staples.
