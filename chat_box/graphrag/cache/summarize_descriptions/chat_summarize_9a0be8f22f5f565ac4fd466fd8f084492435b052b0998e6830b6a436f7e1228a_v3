Fish such as carp and mullet are recognized for their contributions to improved heart health and enhanced immune function, primarily due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. These nutrients play critical roles in reducing inflammation, supporting cardiovascular function, and strengthening the body’s defense mechanisms. Similarly, chicken gizzard and chicken hearts offer significant nutritional value, being rich in high-quality protein, essential vitamins—including vitamins A, C, and the B complex—and key minerals such as iron, zinc, selenium, and magnesium. These components support overall metabolic function, energy production, and cellular health. Notably, these organ meats are low in carbohydrates and fat, making them a lean and nutrient-dense option, especially beneficial for individuals seeking to increase their intake of essential nutrients without excess calories or saturated fats. In traditional dietary practices, chicken gizzard and chicken hearts are sometimes used to help balance internal body conditions, particularly in addressing what is described as \"internal heat,\" a concept rooted in traditional medicine systems that emphasize the body’s equilibrium. While this traditional use may not be supported by modern clinical evidence, it reflects cultural perspectives on the role of these foods in promoting holistic well-being. Despite differences in context—such as the focus on cardiovascular and immune health in fish versus the broader nutrient profile and traditional use in poultry organs—the overarching theme is that these foods provide a rich source of vital nutrients that support physical health. The health benefits of both fish and poultry organs are grounded in their bioavailable macronutrients and micronutrients, which contribute to sustained energy, immune resilience, and metabolic balance. However, it is important to note that while these foods offer nutritional advantages, their consumption should be part of a balanced diet and tailored to individual health needs and medical conditions. In summary, HEALTH BENEFITS encompass a range of physiological and traditional health advantages derived from consuming fish like carp and mullet, as well as poultry organs such as chicken gizzard and chicken hearts, highlighting their value as nutrient-rich, low-fat sources of essential vitamins and minerals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 435, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 693, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
