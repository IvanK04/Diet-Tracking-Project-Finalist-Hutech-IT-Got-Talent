It plays a central role in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a vital molecule involved in numerous biochemical reactions, including fatty acid metabolism and the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. This vitamin is integral to the function of the B-complex vitamins and supports overall cellular energy generation. Pantothenic acid is naturally found in a wide variety of foods, including whole grains, fish, artichokes, and dill. Its presence in these dietary sources ensures that individuals can obtain adequate levels through a balanced diet. The vitamin's role in fatty acid metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining healthy lipid balance and supporting tissue repair and hormone production. While it is commonly associated with energy metabolism, pantothenic acid also contributes to the synthesis of certain hormones and neurotransmitters. Although the specific sources of pantothenic acid vary slightly across descriptions—such as whole grains, fish, artichokes, and dill—these differences do not contradict the core function of the vitamin. Instead, they highlight its broad dietary availability. All provided descriptions consistently emphasize its metabolic functions and presence in plant and animal-based foods, reinforcing its status as a fundamental nutrient. There are no contradictory claims in the data; rather, the descriptions converge on a unified picture of pantothenic acid as a versatile, essential vitamin with critical roles in energy metabolism and biochemical synthesis. Its presence in diverse food sources makes it accessible to most populations, contributing to overall metabolic health. In summary, pantothenic acid is a vital water-soluble vitamin that supports energy production, fatty acid metabolism, and the synthesis of coenzyme A, and is widely available in common dietary items such as whole grains, fish, artichokes, and dill.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 675, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
