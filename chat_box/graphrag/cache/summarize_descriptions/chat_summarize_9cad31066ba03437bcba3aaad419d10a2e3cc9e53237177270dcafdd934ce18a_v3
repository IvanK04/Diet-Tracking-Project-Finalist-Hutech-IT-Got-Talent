These compounds are responsible for its striking color and are linked to various health benefits, such as supporting heart health and reducing inflammation. With a low calorie count, red cabbage is an ideal choice for individuals seeking nutritious, low-calorie foods, including those following vegan diets. Its nutrient density and natural antioxidant profile make it a versatile ingredient in a wide range of culinary applications, from salads and slaws to cooked dishes and fermented products like sauerkraut. The combination of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants supports digestive health, immune function, and overall well-being.
