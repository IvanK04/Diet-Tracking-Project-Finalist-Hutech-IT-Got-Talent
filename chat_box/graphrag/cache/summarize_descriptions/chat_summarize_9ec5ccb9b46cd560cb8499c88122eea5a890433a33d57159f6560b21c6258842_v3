It is found in a variety of foods, including seafood such as scallops, iodized salt, peanut butter, and certain plant-based sources like pears, sầu riêng, and vegetables including ngò tây. Iodine is also present in legumes and some vegetables, though in small amounts. While it is not explicitly detailed in all descriptions, its presence in both animal and plant-based foods is consistently noted. The mineral is particularly important in seafood, which serves as a significant dietary source, and is also available in fortified forms such as iodized salt. Although some descriptions mention iodine's presence without specifying food sources, the consistent emphasis on its role in thyroid hormone production and metabolism confirms its vital biological function. Contradictions in the specificity of food sources are resolved by consolidating the most reliable and varied references, ensuring a comprehensive view of iodine's dietary distribution. Iodine is not abundant in most foods, and its intake must be carefully managed to support optimal thyroid function. Despite occasional omissions or vague references in the provided descriptions, the overarching consensus supports iodine’s essential role in human health and its presence across both animal and plant-based diets. The mineral is especially important in populations with low dietary intake, where supplementation or consumption of iodine-rich foods may be necessary. Overall, iodine remains a critical trace mineral, vital for metabolic regulation and thyroid health, and is widely available in common dietary sources such as seafood, iodized salt, and certain vegetables and fruits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 328, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 688, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
