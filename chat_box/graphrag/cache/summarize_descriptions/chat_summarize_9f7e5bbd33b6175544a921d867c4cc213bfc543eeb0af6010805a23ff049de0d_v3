Each 14-gram serving contains 109.8 calories, 23 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates, and 64 grams of fat, highlighting their high caloric and fatty acid content. These seeds are exceptionally rich in a broad spectrum of vitamins, including B vitamins (such as B12, B6, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and folate), vitamin A, C, D, E, and K, as well as choline. Mineral content includes iron, zinc, copper, iodine, calcium, selenium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, phosphorus, chromium, and molybdenum, with notable levels of calcium and iron supporting bone and blood health. \n\nBlack Sesame Seeds are widely utilized in Asian culinary traditions, where they serve both decorative and functional roles in a variety of dishes—ranging from sweets and baked goods to savory preparations. Their high oil content contributes to their rich texture and flavor profile, making them a valued ingredient in both traditional and modern cooking. Despite their nutritional benefits, Black Sesame Seeds are a known allergen, particularly for individuals with sesame allergies, and should be handled with caution in food preparation and consumption. \n\nHealth-wise, the seeds are cholesterol-free and are particularly praised for their high concentration of B vitamins and essential nutrients, which support energy metabolism, immune function, and overall cellular health. While some descriptions emphasize their mineral richness, particularly calcium and iron, others highlight their comprehensive vitamin profile, which is consistent across sources. There is no contradiction in the data; all descriptions align in affirming the seeds' nutritional value, culinary use, and allergenic properties. The slight repetition in vitamin and mineral lists across descriptions is due to overlapping information, but does not introduce conflicting claims. \n\nIn summary, Black Sesame Seeds are a highly nutritious, flavorful seed product with significant health benefits, widely used in Asian cuisine. They offer a dense array of essential vitamins and minerals, support metabolic and immune functions, and are a key ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. However, due to their allergenic nature, individuals with sesame allergies must avoid them. Their high fat and protein content makes them a substantial food source, and their use in culinary applications underscores their cultural and nutritional importance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 503, "prompt_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 1065, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
