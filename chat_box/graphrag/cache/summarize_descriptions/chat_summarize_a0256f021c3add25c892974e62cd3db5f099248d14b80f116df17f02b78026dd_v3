It contributes to overall cardiovascular health by helping to maintain electrolyte balance and supporting heart function. Found in a wide variety of foods, including black beans, almonds, sunflower seeds, salmon, catfish fillet, chicken livers, coconut water, bean sprouts, bitter melon, vinegar, pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and Vietnamese greens, potassium is present in diverse dietary sources across different food groups. Its functions extend beyond basic physiological processes, supporting digestive health and overall wellness. While potassium is commonly associated with muscle and nerve function, it also plays a key role in fluid balance and blood pressure regulation, making it a critical nutrient for maintaining homeostasis in the body. The mineral is particularly beneficial in helping to counteract the effects of sodium, thereby reducing the risk of hypertension. Although the specific sources of potassium vary—such as plant-based foods like beans, greens, and fruits, as well as animal-based sources like fish and liver—its physiological importance remains consistent across all mentioned contexts. Some descriptions note its presence in less conventional sources like vinegar and sticky rice, which further underscores its broad dietary distribution. Despite minor variations in the specific foods cited, there is no contradiction in the core functions attributed to potassium. All descriptions converge on its central role in fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, nerve signaling, and muscle contractions. Therefore, potassium is recognized as a fundamental mineral essential for human health, with widespread dietary availability and well-documented physiological benefits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 330, "prompt_tokens": 459, "total_tokens": 789, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
