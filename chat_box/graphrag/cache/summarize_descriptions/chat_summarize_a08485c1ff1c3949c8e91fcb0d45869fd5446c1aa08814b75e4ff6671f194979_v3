It is found in a diverse range of dietary sources, including black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, chicken livers, sunflower seeds, salmon, pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, catfish fillet, and dồi huyết (a type of blood sausage). These sources highlight its broad presence across plant and animal-based foods. Selenium functions as a key component in the body’s antioxidant defense system, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals and reduce cellular damage. Its importance in thyroid function is consistently emphasized across multiple sources, where it supports the proper metabolism of thyroid hormones. Additionally, selenium contributes to overall immune system resilience, enhancing the body’s ability to defend against infections and maintain homeostasis. While some descriptions mention specific foods like sticky rice or catfish fillet, the overarching theme is the mineral’s consistent role in antioxidant activity and its vital support for thyroid and immune health. The Vietnamese language descriptions confirm the mineral’s role in immune and antioxidant support, reinforcing the global relevance of these functions. Although some descriptions are repetitive or slightly redundant, they collectively affirm selenium’s multifaceted benefits. There are no contradictory claims in the data; all descriptions align in identifying selenium as a trace mineral with antioxidant properties and functional benefits for the thyroid and immune system. The presence of selenium in both plant and animal sources underscores its dietary versatility. In summary, selenium is a vital trace mineral found in a wide array of foods, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular health, supporting thyroid function, and enhancing immune system performance through its potent antioxidant activity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 778, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
