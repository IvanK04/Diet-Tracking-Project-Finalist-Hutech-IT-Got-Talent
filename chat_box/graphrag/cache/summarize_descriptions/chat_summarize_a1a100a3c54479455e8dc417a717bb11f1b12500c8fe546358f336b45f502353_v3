It plays a vital role in supporting muscle development, bodily functions, and muscle recovery, making it essential for dietary planning aimed at maintaining physical health and energy levels. The protein content varies across dishes, with Trạch tẩm bột chiên providing 62.7g and Tôm sốt cà chua offering 16.5g, highlighting its significant contribution to nutritional intake. This high concentration in certain dishes underscores its importance in promoting tissue repair and overall metabolic function. Additionally, protein is a primary source of essential amino acids, which are critical for building and repairing muscles, supporting immune function, and maintaining satiety. Its presence in both animal-based sources such as eggs, frozen shrimp, and yellowfin tuna, as well as in specific prepared dishes like Cá trôi rán sốt cà chua, demonstrates its widespread availability and dietary relevance. While the exact protein content differs between dishes, the consistent emphasis across descriptions confirms its central role in nutritional support. The repeated mention of muscle development and recovery across all sources indicates that PROTEIN is not only a structural component of the body but also a key driver in physical performance and recovery. Despite minor variations in the quantity reported, there is no contradiction in the overall function of protein as a nutrient that supports muscle growth and bodily maintenance. Therefore, PROTEIN stands out as a foundational element in balanced diets, particularly for individuals engaged in physical activity or seeking to enhance muscle mass and recovery. Its presence in both high-protein and moderate-protein dishes ensures accessibility across different meal types, reinforcing its value in daily nutrition. In summary, PROTEIN is a critical macronutrient that supports muscle development, recovery, and overall physiological function, found in diverse food sources and dishes, and essential for effective dietary planning.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 688, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
