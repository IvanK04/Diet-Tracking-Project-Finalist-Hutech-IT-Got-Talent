It plays a central role in maintaining skeletal integrity, enabling proper muscle contraction, facilitating nerve impulse transmission, and supporting the coagulation process in the bloodstream. Found in a wide variety of foods, calcium is present in dairy products, leafy greens such as kale, spinach, and green cabbage, as well as in fish, including grouper and squid, and in fortified foods. It is also detected in plant-based sources such as amaranth, coconut, mango, lemon, cinnamon, and galangal, as well as in certain oils like coconut oil, peanut oil, and sunflower oil. Additionally, calcium is present in some pork products, chicken wings, and even in vegetables like cucumber and tomato, contributing to overall physiological function. While it is commonly associated with dairy, its presence in diverse food groups—ranging from legumes and nuts like walnuts to non-dairy items such as baby corn and milk caramel filled squares—demonstrates its broad dietary availability. The mineral supports not only bone development and tooth formation but also critical bodily processes such as muscle contraction and nerve signaling. Although some descriptions mention calcium in less conventional sources like brown sugar or caramel, these are likely incidental or trace findings and do not represent primary sources. There is no contradiction in the descriptions regarding calcium’s biological functions; rather, they collectively emphasize its multifaceted importance and wide distribution across the food supply. The consistent theme across all references is calcium’s indispensable role in human health, particularly in maintaining strong bones and enabling proper muscular and neurological function. Its presence in both animal and plant-based foods ensures accessibility across different dietary patterns. Therefore, calcium remains a fundamental nutrient, essential for the development and maintenance of a healthy body, with sources spanning from traditional staples like milk and leafy greens to more diverse and emerging food items.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 527, "total_tokens": 916, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
