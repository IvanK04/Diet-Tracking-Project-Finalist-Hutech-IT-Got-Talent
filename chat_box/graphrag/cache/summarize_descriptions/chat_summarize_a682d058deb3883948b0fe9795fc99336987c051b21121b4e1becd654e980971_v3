It is prized for its crisp texture when raw and its soft, naturally sweet consistency when cooked, making it a versatile ingredient in a variety of culinary applications. Carrots are a nutrient-dense food, rich in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A (derived from beta-carotene), vitamin C, and potassium. Beta-carotene, a carotenoid found abundantly in carrots, is converted by the body into vitamin A, supporting vision, immune function, and skin health. Additionally, carrots are low in calories and high in dietary fiber, contributing to digestive wellness and overall nutritional balance. Their earthy flavor and firm structure make them ideal for use in soups, stews, salads, and as a side dish. In traditional Vietnamese cuisine, carrots play a notable role in Nộm tai heo thập cẩm, where they enhance both the dish’s visual appeal and its nutritional profile, particularly through the provision of beta-carotene and dietary fiber. Whether consumed raw, grilled, or cooked, carrots maintain their nutritional value and are valued across diverse cuisines for their adaptability and health benefits. The vegetable’s versatility extends from simple snacking to complex dishes, solidifying its status as a staple in global diets. Despite variations in color and preparation, all forms of carrot share a consistent profile of high nutritional quality and culinary utility. Carrot remains a foundational ingredient in both everyday meals and culturally significant dishes, offering a balance of flavor, texture, and health-promoting nutrients.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 404, "total_tokens": 736, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
