It is found in a wide variety of foods, including animal-based sources such as whole chicken, beef, beef sausage, pork belly, pork ears, sea bass, scallops, and egg yolk, as well as plant-based options like legumes, leafy greens (including spinach, cải bó xôi, cai xoong, ngò rí, tía tô, kinh giới, and ngò tây), and vegetables such as asparagus, parsnips, chili peppers, red cabbage, ridge gourd, and glass noodles. Iron is also present in certain grains, including corn and tapioca flour, and in foods like egg noodles, paprika, shallots, artichoke, and sò điệp. Notably, some sources highlight iron as being \"extremely rich\" in specific foods, indicating high concentrations. While iron is essential for preventing anemia and supporting immune function, its bioavailability can vary depending on food sources and dietary context. The mineral contributes to red blood cell formation, oxygen delivery to tissues, and energy production throughout the body. Although commonly associated with animal products, plant-based sources such as leafy greens and legumes also provide significant iron content. Iron's presence in diverse foods—ranging from traditional meats to vegetables and processed items like fortified cereals—demonstrates its broad dietary relevance. Despite minor inconsistencies in specific food pairings, all descriptions converge on iron’s central role in oxygen transport and hemoglobin synthesis, affirming its importance across both human nutrition and metabolic health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 909, "total_tokens": 1250, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
