Found naturally in a variety of foods such as sunflower seeds, fish, kumquats, pork belly, and shallots, magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, underscoring its fundamental importance in biological function. These reactions span a wide range of bodily activities, including muscle and nerve function, energy production, and the maintenance of healthy bones. Its role in muscle and nerve function is particularly significant, as magnesium helps regulate the electrical activity of cells, ensuring proper muscle contraction and nerve signal transmission. Additionally, magnesium contributes to energy metabolism by participating in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. It also supports bone health by aiding in the formation and mineralization of bone tissue, working in conjunction with other minerals like calcium and phosphorus. While the specific food sources of magnesium vary—such as sunflower seeds, fish, kumquats, pork belly, and shallots—this diversity highlights its widespread availability in the diet. The consistent mention across multiple descriptions of magnesium’s involvement in over 300 enzymatic reactions reinforces its status as a vital cofactor in metabolic pathways. Although some descriptions note its presence in specific foods like pork belly and shallots, these are not contradictory to the broader role of magnesium in health; rather, they illustrate the mineral’s dietary diversity. The repeated emphasis on muscle and nerve function, energy production, and bone health aligns across all sources, forming a coherent and comprehensive picture of magnesium’s biological significance. There are no conflicting claims regarding its functions or sources; instead, the descriptions converge on a unified understanding of magnesium as a foundational mineral supporting core physiological systems. Therefore, the final summary reflects a well-integrated, scientifically grounded account of magnesium’s role in human health, emphasizing its presence in common dietary sources and its indispensable function in enzymatic processes that sustain life. Magnesium, in all its dietary and biological roles, remains a cornerstone of metabolic and structural health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 420, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 689, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
