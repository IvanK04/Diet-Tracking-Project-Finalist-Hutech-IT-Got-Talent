It is protected by a natural shell and serves as a high-quality source of protein, essential vitamins, and minerals. The egg contains both the white (albumen) and the yolk, with the yolk being particularly rich in cholesterol, as well as vital vitamins such as A, D, and B12, and minerals like iron and selenium. Despite its nutritional value, the yolk's cholesterol content is a point of consideration in dietary planning. In culinary applications, egg functions as a binding and flavoring agent in various traditional dishes. For instance, in Vietnamese cuisine, it is a primary ingredient in *Mực trứng chiên* (fried squid with egg), where it combines with squid to form a cohesive and flavorful dish. In *Nem rán* (fried spring roll) and *Chả giò chiên* (fried minced meat roll), egg is used as a key component in the savory filling, helping to bind ingredients and enhance texture and taste. These uses highlight the versatility of egg in both savory and binding roles across different cuisines. While some descriptions emphasize its nutritional profile, others focus on its functional role in cooking, which together illustrate that EGG is not only a nutritious food source but also a fundamental ingredient in traditional food preparation. The consistency of its use across different dishes underscores its importance in both nutrition and culinary practices. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; rather, they complement each other by covering both the biological and culinary aspects of the egg. Thus, EGG stands out as a multifaceted food product—nutritionally rich, structurally functional, and culturally significant in food traditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
