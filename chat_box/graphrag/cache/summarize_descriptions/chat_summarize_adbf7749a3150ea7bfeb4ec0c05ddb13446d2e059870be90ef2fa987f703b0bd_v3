This makes honey not only a flavorful ingredient but also a substance with potential health benefits. Scientifically, a standard serving of honey weighs 21 grams and contains 69.44 calories, 0.06 grams of protein, 17.3 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of fat. Despite its low protein and fat content, honey provides essential vitamins, including niacin, vitamin C, and various B-complex vitamins, as well as key minerals such as iron, zinc, and potassium. These nutritional components contribute to its role as a functional food with both culinary and potential therapeutic applications. While some classifications may place honey under categories like 'dầu và gia vị' (oil and condiments), this categorization appears to be a linguistic or regional misalignment, as honey is fundamentally a natural sweetener and a bee-produced product, not an oil or spice. Therefore, it is more accurately described as a natural sweetener and a nutrient-rich food. The presence of enzymes such as glucose oxidase and antioxidants like flavonoids further enhances its biological activity, supporting its use in traditional and modern health practices. Its antibacterial properties, particularly against certain strains of bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus*, have been documented in scientific studies, making it a valuable component in wound care and natural remedies. Additionally, honey's stability and long shelf life—due to its low moisture content and high sugar concentration—make it a practical ingredient in both home kitchens and commercial food production. Although the specific nutritional values provided are based on a standard 21-gram serving, it is important to note that honey's composition can vary slightly depending on the floral source, geographic region, and beekeeping practices. This variability contributes to the diversity of honey types, such as clover, manuka, and acacia honey, each with unique flavor profiles and potential health benefits. Despite some inconsistencies in categorization, the core attributes of honey—its origin, composition, and functional properties—remain consistent across all descriptions. In conclusion, honey is a multifaceted natural product that serves as a sweetener, a source of essential nutrients, and a substance with demonstrated biological activity. Its combination of sweetness, nutritional value, and health-promoting properties positions it as a significant component in both dietary and wellness contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 505, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 787, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
