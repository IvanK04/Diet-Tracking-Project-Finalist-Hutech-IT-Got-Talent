Classified under legumes, they are a rich source of plant-based protein, dietary fiber, and a wide array of essential vitamins and minerals, including B6, B12, folate, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin A, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, choline, iron, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium. While some sources list vitamin C and D as present, it is important to note that vitamin C is not typically abundant in soybeans, and its presence may be due to processing or contamination; thus, the inclusion of vitamin C is considered less reliable and is not emphasized. The primary and well-documented nutrients remain the B vitamins, iron, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. Boiled soybeans are naturally gluten-free, dairy-free, and free from saturated fats, making them a heart-healthy option. They are low in fat and moderate in calories, with a high content of non-saturated fats and antioxidants, contributing to overall health. As a complete protein source, boiled soybeans offer all essential amino acids, making them particularly valuable in plant-based diets. They are suitable for vegetarians, vegans, and individuals following a plant-based or low-fat lifestyle. The product can be consumed either whole or shelled, depending on preference and culinary use. Boiled soybeans are widely recognized for their nutritional density and versatility in global cuisines. Their high fiber content supports digestive health, while their mineral profile contributes to bone strength, immune function, and energy metabolism. Despite some conflicting claims about specific vitamins, the overall nutritional profile remains consistent and well-supported by scientific evidence. Boiled soybeans are a sustainable, accessible, and health-promoting food choice, especially in diets emphasizing plant-based nutrition and reduced animal product consumption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 752, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
