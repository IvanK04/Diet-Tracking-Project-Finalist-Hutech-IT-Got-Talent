This technique emphasizes speed and precision, resulting in crisp textures and vibrant flavors. Commonly used flavoring components include garlic and bean sprouts, which contribute both aroma and a satisfying textural contrast to the dish. While stir-fry is traditionally associated with Asian culinary traditions, its influence has expanded across diverse global cuisines, adapting to local ingredients and preferences. The method often incorporates dark soy sauce to enhance both the depth of flavor and the rich, reddish color of the final dish. In some regional variations, stir-fry may include glutinous rice and aromatic herbs such as lemon grass and red peppers, particularly in East and Southeast Asian preparations. These elements combine to create a balanced dish that blends savory, earthy, and slightly sweet notes. Although the core technique remains consistent—high-heat, quick cooking with a focus on fresh ingredients—regional adaptations introduce unique ingredient combinations, reflecting local tastes and available produce. The use of high heat ensures that ingredients retain their structure and freshness, preventing overcooking. Stir-fry is not only a method of cooking but also a cultural expression of culinary innovation, where tradition and creativity intersect. Despite some variations in ingredient selection, the fundamental principles of speed, heat, and flavor balance remain central to the technique. Contradictions in the descriptions—such as the mention of glutinous rice and herbs in one and garlic/bean sprouts in others—are reconciled by recognizing that stir-fry is a flexible method with regional variations. Thus, while garlic and bean sprouts are widely used as standard components, certain regional versions may incorporate glutinous rice or herbs like lemon grass and red peppers. This adaptability underscores stir-fry’s role as a dynamic and inclusive cooking technique. In summary, stir-fry is a high-heat, quick-cooking method rooted in Asian cuisine but embraced globally, featuring key elements such as garlic, bean sprouts, and dark soy sauce, with regional variations introducing additional ingredients like glutinous rice and aromatic herbs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 727, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
