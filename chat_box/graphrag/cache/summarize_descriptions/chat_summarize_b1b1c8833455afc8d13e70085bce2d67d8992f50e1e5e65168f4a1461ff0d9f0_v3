It is an excellent source of complete protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vital vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin A, vitamin E, iron, zinc, and selenium. These nutritional components make salmon a valuable component of a balanced diet, especially for individuals prioritizing heart health, immune function, and overall well-being. The fish is commonly consumed in both raw and cooked forms, with raw consumption—such as in sashimi or ceviche—being particularly popular due to its rich flavor and nutrient retention. The presence of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), supports cardiovascular health by reducing inflammation and lowering triglyceride levels. Additionally, vitamin D contributes to bone health and immune regulation, while vitamin B12 plays a critical role in red blood cell formation and neurological function. Selenium, a powerful antioxidant, helps protect cells from oxidative damage and supports thyroid function. Despite some variations in the descriptions, all sources consistently highlight salmon’s nutritional superiority, with a particular emphasis on its low saturated fat and high nutrient density. While some descriptions refer to salmon in general, the specific mention of Atlantic salmon in several entries indicates that this species is a primary focus, likely due to its widespread availability and culinary popularity. There is no contradiction among the descriptions; rather, they reinforce each other by emphasizing salmon’s health benefits, protein quality, and nutrient composition. The recurring themes of omega-3 content, low saturated fat, and high vitamin and mineral levels provide a unified and coherent picture of salmon as a health-promoting food. Whether prepared raw or cooked, salmon remains a preferred choice among health-conscious consumers seeking to enhance their dietary intake of essential nutrients. Its versatility in culinary applications and consistent nutritional profile across different preparation methods further solidify its status as a staple in modern, balanced diets. In summary, salmon—especially Atlantic salmon—is a nutrient-dense, low-saturated-fat fish that offers significant health advantages, making it a vital and widely recommended food source for promoting long-term wellness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 461, "prompt_tokens": 365, "total_tokens": 826, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
