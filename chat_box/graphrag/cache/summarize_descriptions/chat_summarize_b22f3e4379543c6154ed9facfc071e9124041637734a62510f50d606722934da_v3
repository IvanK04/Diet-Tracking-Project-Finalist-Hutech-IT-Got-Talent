It grows as a bulb composed of individual cloves and is widely cultivated for use in global cuisines. Garlic is a foundational ingredient in many traditional dishes, such as Rau khoai lang xào tỏi and Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, where it enhances flavor and contributes to the dish's character. The plant contains sulfur compounds, most notably allicin, which is released and activated when garlic is crushed, chopped, or sliced. This compound is responsible for its sharp taste and is believed to offer various health benefits, including antimicrobial and cardiovascular support. While garlic is low in calories, its role in cooking extends beyond mere seasoning—it transforms in flavor depending on preparation methods, becoming milder and sweeter when roasted or stir-fried, and more pungent when used fresh. Despite its strong initial aroma, garlic serves as a versatile and essential flavoring agent across diverse culinary traditions. Its use in both savory dishes and medicinal contexts underscores its importance in both gastronomy and wellness. The compound allicin, activated upon mechanical disruption, is central to garlic’s unique properties and its recognized health-promoting potential. Overall, garlic stands out as a key ingredient that not only enriches the taste of food but also contributes to nutritional and health-related benefits when properly prepared.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 391, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
