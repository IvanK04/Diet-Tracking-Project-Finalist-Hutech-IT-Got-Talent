It is vital for maintaining proper physiological processes, including cardiovascular health and muscle and nervous system activity. Found in a wide variety of foods, potassium is present in fruits such as bananas, cantaloupe, strawberries, and ripe mangoes, as well as in vegetables like spinach, asparagus, turnip greens, red cabbage, and ridge gourd. It is also abundant in legumes, including soybeans and beans, and in animal products such as whole chicken, fish (including sea bass and scallops), beef, pork mince, and beef sausage. Specific plant-based sources include red beets, paprika, chili peppers, parsnips, shallots, bitter melon, and Vietnamese herbs such as *kinh giới*, *ngò tây*, and *cải bó xôi*. Additionally, potassium is found in less commonly recognized sources like peanut butter, glass noodles, egg noodles, tofu, artichoke, sò điệp (scallops), and young coconut squares. While some descriptions mention its presence in unusual items such as pork ears or red pepper flakes, these are likely minor or context-specific. The consistent theme across all descriptions is potassium’s central role in fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, and muscle and nerve function. Although one description notes potassium is present in \"Vietnamese Balm\" and \"Beef\" without further detail, and another states it is listed in mineral data but not specifically described, these do not contradict the broader consensus. All sources converge on potassium’s importance in maintaining homeostasis, particularly in the cardiovascular and muscular systems. Thus, potassium is a widely distributed mineral essential for human health, found across diverse dietary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 897, "total_tokens": 1269, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
