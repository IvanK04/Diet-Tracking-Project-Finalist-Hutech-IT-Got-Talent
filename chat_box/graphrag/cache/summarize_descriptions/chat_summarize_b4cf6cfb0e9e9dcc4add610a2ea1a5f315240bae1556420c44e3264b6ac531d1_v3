It serves as a key ingredient in Miến riêu cua (crab noodle soup) and bún riêu bò (beef rice noodle soup), where it contributes both depth of flavor and a significant amount of protein. The paste is derived from crab meat, processed to create a smooth, aromatic base that integrates seamlessly into the broth, giving the dishes their distinctive umami profile. While it is often associated with seafood-based soups, gạch cua is not a standalone food item but rather a culinary component that functions as a flavor enhancer and protein source. Its use in these dishes highlights its importance in Vietnamese culinary traditions, where balance and complexity of taste are highly valued. Despite some descriptions referring to it as a \"crab paste ingredient,\" the consistent use across multiple dishes confirms that gạch cua is specifically a prepared paste form of crab meat, not a raw or whole crab product. There is no contradiction between the descriptions provided, as both emphasize its role in flavor and protein content within Vietnamese soups. The ingredient is particularly prominent in soups that feature a rich, brothy base, where its texture and taste blend well with noodles, herbs, and other components. Overall, gạch cua plays a vital role in the authenticity and sensory appeal of traditional Vietnamese dishes, especially those centered around seafood-based broths. Its preparation and use reflect the nuanced approach to ingredient selection in Vietnamese cooking, where even small components contribute significantly to the final taste. As a result, gạch cua remains a distinctive and essential element in the preparation of Miến riêu cua and bún riêu bò, offering both nutritional value and a complex, satisfying flavor profile.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 377, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 580, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
