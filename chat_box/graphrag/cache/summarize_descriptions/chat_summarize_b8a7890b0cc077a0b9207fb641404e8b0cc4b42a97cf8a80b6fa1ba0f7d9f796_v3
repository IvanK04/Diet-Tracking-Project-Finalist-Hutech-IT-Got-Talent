It includes a variety of plant-based and protein-rich foods that support optimal nutrition. Whole grains, such as whole wheat bread, are preferred over white bread due to their higher fiber and vitamin content, contributing to improved digestion and cardiovascular health. The diet incorporates a wide range of vegetables, including rau cải ngồng xào tỏi, rau cải ngọt xào, and rau cải chíp xào nấm, which are rich in dietary fiber, vitamins such as Vitamin C and beta-carotene, and antioxidants. These vegetables support immune function, vision, and metabolic balance. Additionally, fish dishes like ca thu chen and ca tre chen are included for their high content of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, which are vital for cardiovascular and neurological health. Carrots and pickled mustard greens are also part of the diet, providing essential vitamins and antioxidants that enhance vision, immune function, and heart health. The overall structure of HEALTHY DIET is centered on low fat, high fiber consumption, which aids in weight management and long-term wellness. This comprehensive approach integrates both plant-based and animal-based foods to ensure a well-rounded intake of macronutrients and micronutrients. While some descriptions highlight specific dishes, the unifying theme is a consistent focus on nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods that support bodily functions and disease prevention. Contradictions in the descriptions—such as varying emphasis on specific dishes—are resolved by recognizing that these dishes serve as examples within a broader, coherent framework of balanced nutrition. Thus, HEALTHY DIET is not defined by a single food item but by a holistic pattern of eating that prioritizes whole, natural ingredients and their health-promoting properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
