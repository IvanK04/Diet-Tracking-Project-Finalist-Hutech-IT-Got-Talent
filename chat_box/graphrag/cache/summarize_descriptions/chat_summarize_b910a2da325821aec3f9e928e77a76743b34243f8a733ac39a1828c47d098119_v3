Each 113-gram serving contains 265 calories, 10.6 grams of protein, 51.3 grams of carbohydrates, and 1.33 grams of fat. It is a high-carbohydrate food, with low dietary fiber content, and notable sodium levels, making it less suitable for individuals seeking low-sodium or high-fiber diets. The product provides essential vitamins, including vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as trace minerals such as calcium, iron, and sodium. While it offers moderate protein and fat content, its nutritional profile is dominated by carbohydrates, which may contribute to energy intake but should be consumed in balance with other food groups. The high sodium content warrants caution for individuals managing blood pressure or cardiovascular health. Despite being a grain-based product, Wonton Noodle is not a traditional noodle in the sense of being made from wheat flour and water; rather, it is formulated as a ready-to-eat cereal, combining the texture and name of noodles with cereal characteristics. This classification places it in a unique position between traditional noodles and processed grain-based snacks. The product's nutritional composition reflects a formulation designed for quick consumption and energy provision, typical of breakfast cereals. However, due to its low fiber content, it may not support optimal digestive health or satiety when consumed as a sole food source. The presence of vitamins A and C supports immune function and skin health, while calcium and iron contribute to bone and blood health, though the amounts may be insufficient for individuals with specific dietary needs. Overall, Wonton Noodle serves as a convenient, energy-dense option with a balanced mix of macronutrients, but its high carbohydrate and sodium content, along with low fiber, suggest it should be consumed in moderation as part of a varied and balanced diet. Its categorization as both a cereal and a noodle-related food highlights its hybrid nature, blending elements of both food types. This dual classification underscores the evolving nature of food product development, where traditional names are applied to modern formulations. While it shares some characteristics with traditional noodles—such as a noodle-like texture or name—it differs significantly in composition and nutritional value. Therefore, consumers should be aware that Wonton Noodle is not a direct substitute for whole-grain or fiber-rich noodles. Instead, it functions as a processed, high-calorie, low-fiber cereal that provides basic nutrients but lacks the health benefits associated with whole grains. In summary, Wonton Noodle is a processed grain-based cereal with a high carbohydrate and sodium content, moderate protein, and low fiber. It offers vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron, but its nutritional profile is best suited for occasional consumption within a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 579, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 886, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
