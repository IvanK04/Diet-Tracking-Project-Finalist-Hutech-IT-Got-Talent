It provides a comprehensive evaluation of vitamin B9 content in diets, enabling accurate comparisons across different food types and dietary patterns. FOLATE_DFE reflects the biological activity of folate, accounting for differences in bioavailability between natural folate and synthetic folic acid. As a water-soluble B-vitamin, folate plays a critical role in DNA synthesis and cell division, making it essential for normal cellular function and development.  \n\nFOLATE_DFE is particularly vital during pregnancy, where adequate intake helps prevent neural tube defects and supports healthy fetal development. This makes it a key nutrient in maternal and prenatal health. The vitamin is naturally present in a variety of foods, including bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, carp, and sticky rice, demonstrating its broad dietary availability. While folate exists in different forms—such as the naturally occurring folates in foods—DFE standardizes these into a single metric to reflect their equivalent biological impact.  \n\nThe importance of FOLATE_DFE extends beyond pregnancy, contributing to overall cellular health and the maintenance of normal metabolic processes. Its presence in plant-based foods like bean sprouts and seeds, as well as in animal sources such as carp, underscores its role in diverse dietary patterns. Although the term \"Folate DFE\" is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a distinct chemical form, it is actually a unit of measurement that quantifies total folate intake, encompassing both dietary folates and folic acid.  \n\nIn summary, FOLATE_DFE is a critical tool in nutritional assessment, providing a reliable way to evaluate vitamin B9 intake and its implications for health. It supports DNA synthesis and cell division, is especially important during pregnancy, and is found in a wide range of foods, including beans, seeds, fish, and grains. By standardizing folate measurement, FOLATE_DFE enhances the accuracy of dietary evaluations and contributes to better health outcomes, particularly in populations at risk for folate deficiency.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 433, "prompt_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 775, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
