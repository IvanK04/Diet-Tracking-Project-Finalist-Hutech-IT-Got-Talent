It supports muscle relaxation, nerve signaling, and metabolic processes, contributing to overall physiological function. Magnesium is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and vegetables such as asparagus, parsnips, chili peppers, turnip greens, and ridge gourd. It is also found in plant-based foods like soybeans, tofu, egg noodles, artichokes, red beets, paprika, and young coconut squares. Animal-based sources include chicken breast, sea bass, beef, beef sausage, scallops, and pork ears. Additionally, magnesium is present in specific herbs and spices such as red pepper flakes, paprika, shallots, dill, and ngò tây (cilantro), as well as in foods like glass noodles, red cabbage, and tapioca flour. It is part of the vitamin B group and contributes to the mineral content of various foods, including Vietnamese Balm and kinh giới. While some descriptions note its presence in less common items like peanut butter and sò điệp (mussel), the consistent theme across all sources is magnesium’s vital role in enzymatic activity and its broad dietary availability. Despite minor variations in specific food sources, there is no contradiction in the core functions or sources of magnesium. The mineral is essential for maintaining proper nerve and muscle function, supporting energy metabolism, and promoting bone integrity. Its presence in both plant and animal-based foods underscores its accessibility and importance in a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 885, "total_tokens": 1231, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
