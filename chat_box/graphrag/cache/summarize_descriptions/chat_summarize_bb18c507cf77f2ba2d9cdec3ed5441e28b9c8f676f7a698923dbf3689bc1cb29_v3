It plays a crucial role in the synthesis of proteins involved in coagulation and bone mineralization, supporting both blood clotting and bone metabolism. Found in a variety of dietary sources, Vitamin K is present in bơ tươi (fresh coconut oil), black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, carp, ngò tây (basil), and leek. It is also detected in oils such as peanut oil (dầu mè) and coconut oil (dầu dừa), highlighting its presence in both plant-based and animal-based foods. While the specific sources vary slightly across descriptions, the consistent theme across all references is Vitamin K’s vital function in maintaining proper blood clotting and promoting bone health through calcium absorption and bone mineralization. The vitamin is particularly important in metabolic processes that ensure the body can effectively utilize calcium for structural integrity in bones and teeth. Although some descriptions mention specific foods like sunflower seeds and carp, others emphasize broader plant sources such as beans and leafy greens, which aligns with the general dietary profile of Vitamin K. There are no contradictory claims regarding its functions; rather, the descriptions reinforce the same core biological roles and dietary sources. The presence of Vitamin K in both animal and plant-based foods underscores its widespread availability in the diet. Overall, Vitamin K is recognized as a key nutrient that supports physiological functions critical to human health, especially in preventing excessive bleeding and maintaining strong, healthy bones. Its role in coagulation and bone metabolism makes it indispensable in daily bodily functions. Despite variations in listed food sources, all descriptions converge on the same fundamental scientific and nutritional significance. Thus, Vitamin K stands as a vital micronutrient with broad dietary sources and essential physiological roles.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 364, "prompt_tokens": 333, "total_tokens": 697, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
