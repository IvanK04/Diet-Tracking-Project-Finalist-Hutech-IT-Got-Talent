It is commonly incorporated into both main courses and side dishes, contributing to the overall taste profile of meals served for lunch and dinner. MUỐI is particularly noted for its presence in traditional dishes such as da heo (pork) and sunflower seeds, demonstrating its versatility across different culinary applications. Despite its widespread use, MUỐI is recognized for its high sodium content, which should be considered in dietary planning, especially for individuals managing blood pressure or sodium intake.  \n\nWhile MUỐI is often associated with flavor enhancement, it is also linked to specific health-oriented meal preparations. Some sources describe it as part of low-calorie, vitamin-rich meals that contain antioxidant properties, and others emphasize its role in high-fiber, low-calorie meal plans with similar health benefits. These descriptions collectively suggest that MUỐI is not only a flavor enhancer but also a component of balanced, health-conscious eating patterns. However, the presence of high sodium content presents a potential dietary concern, particularly when consumed in excess. Therefore, its inclusion in meals should be balanced with other ingredients to ensure nutritional harmony.  \n\nThe conflicting aspects—such as its role in low-calorie, antioxidant-rich meals versus its high sodium content—can be reconciled by understanding that MUỐI functions as a flavoring agent in a variety of dishes, including both traditional and health-focused recipes. Its use in low-calorie, high-fiber meals may be due to its minimal caloric contribution relative to other ingredients, while the sodium content remains a notable characteristic that must be managed. This duality highlights the importance of mindful usage in meal planning, especially for individuals with specific dietary needs.  \n\nIn summary, MUỐI is an essential seasoning in Vietnamese cuisine, used across a broad range of dishes—from main courses to side dishes—enhancing flavor and contributing to the cultural and culinary identity of the cuisine. It is frequently found in dishes like da heo and sunflower seeds, underscoring its adaptability. While it supports the creation of low-calorie, high-fiber, and antioxidant-rich meals, its high sodium content necessitates careful moderation. Thus, MUỐI serves as both a culinary staple and a nutritional consideration, requiring balanced integration into dietary regimens. Its role in weight loss meals is not definitive but may be context-dependent, relying on overall meal composition rather than MUỐI alone. Ultimately, MUỐI remains a vital and versatile ingredient in Vietnamese food culture, valued for its flavor and its place in both traditional and health-conscious meal planning.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 535, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 803, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
