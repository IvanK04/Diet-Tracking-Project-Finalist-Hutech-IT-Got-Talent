It emphasizes the use of foods in their most natural state—such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats—while avoiding or significantly reducing the intake of artificial additives, preservatives, sugars, and refined ingredients. This approach is not merely a condition but rather a conscious goal aimed at improving overall health by supporting the body’s natural functions and reducing exposure to potentially harmful substances commonly found in industrially processed foods. The core principle of CLEAN EATING lies in promoting nutritional integrity by prioritizing ingredient transparency and food quality. By focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, individuals practicing CLEAN EATING often report improved energy levels, better digestion, and enhanced mental clarity. While it is sometimes described as a condition, it is more accurately understood as a proactive dietary goal rooted in wellness and long-term health. The emphasis on minimal processing and preparation reflects a broader movement toward mindful eating, where food is not only consumed but also respected for its natural properties and origins. This philosophy encourages individuals to read labels, understand food sources, and make informed choices that align with their health objectives. Although the term may be used in various contexts, including fitness, nutrition, and wellness communities, CLEAN EATING consistently promotes a balanced, sustainable, and health-conscious relationship with food. It does not prescribe rigid rules or eliminate entire food groups, but instead offers a flexible framework that can be adapted to individual needs and preferences. Ultimately, CLEAN EATING serves as both a practical guide and a mindset shift, encouraging people to prioritize food quality over convenience or taste alone. Its foundation in natural, whole ingredients supports a holistic view of health, where diet is seen as a key component of physical, emotional, and environmental well-being.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 370, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 547, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
