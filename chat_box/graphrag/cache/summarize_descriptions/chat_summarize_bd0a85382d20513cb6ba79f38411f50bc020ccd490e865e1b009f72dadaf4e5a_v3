Vitamin C in mangoes helps strengthen the body’s defense mechanisms, enhancing the immune system’s ability to fight off infections and illnesses. Additionally, this essential vitamin plays a crucial role in collagen production, a structural protein necessary for maintaining healthy skin, blood vessels, bones, and connective tissues. The presence of vitamin C in mangoes contributes not only to overall immune health but also to the maintenance of skin integrity and tissue repair. Multiple sources confirm that mango contains vitamin C, emphasizing its dual benefits as both an immune booster and a contributor to collagen synthesis. These properties make mango a valuable addition to a balanced diet, particularly for individuals seeking natural ways to support their immune system and promote skin health. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions; all consistently highlight the presence of vitamin C in mango and its beneficial effects on immunity and tissue health. Therefore, the comprehensive summary reflects a unified and coherent understanding of the relationship between mango and vitamin C. The information underscores that mango is not only a delicious and widely consumed fruit but also a functional food with scientifically supported health benefits. Its vitamin C content supports both immediate immune function and long-term physiological processes such as tissue regeneration. This makes mango a particularly beneficial food for daily consumption, especially during times of increased stress or exposure to pathogens. The antioxidant nature of vitamin C in mango also helps neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases. While the exact concentration of vitamin C may vary depending on ripeness, variety, and growing conditions, the consistent presence of this nutrient across different mango types confirms its reliability as a dietary source. Overall, mango stands out as a natural, accessible, and effective source of vitamin C, offering a combination of flavor and health-promoting properties that align with modern nutritional science. The synergy between the fruit’s taste and its biological benefits makes it a preferred choice in both traditional and contemporary diets. In conclusion, mango and vitamin C are intrinsically linked through their shared role in supporting immune health and tissue integrity, establishing mango as a key contributor to a well-balanced, health-conscious lifestyle.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 455, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 649, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
