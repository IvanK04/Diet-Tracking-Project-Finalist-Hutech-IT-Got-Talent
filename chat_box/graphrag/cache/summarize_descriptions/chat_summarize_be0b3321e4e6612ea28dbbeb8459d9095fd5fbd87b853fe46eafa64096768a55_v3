It plays a vital role in supporting eye health, immune system function, and skin beauty. In Nộm bò khô, beta-carotene content is 1181.3 µg per serving, contributing to vision and immune health. In Cháo lươn cay, it is present at 110.9 mg (equivalent to 110,900 µg), which converts to vitamin A and supports eye and immune function. In rau cải ngồng xào tỏi, beta-carotene supports eye health and skin beauty, enhancing the dish’s nutritional value. The highest concentration reported is in Cá rô phi rán, which contains 2850 µg per serving, offering significant benefits for vision and overall health. While some descriptions note beta-carotene as being derived from fish and tomatoes, others emphasize its presence in plant-based sources like sugarcane juice and pineapple juice, indicating a broad dietary origin. Despite variations in reported quantities across dishes, all descriptions agree on beta-carotene’s essential role in promoting vision, immune function, and general well-being. The nutrient is consistently recognized as a key component in the nutritional profile of these traditional dishes, making them valuable sources of vitamin A precursors. Although the exact sources and concentrations vary, the overall function of beta-carotene remains consistent—supporting eye health, immune system strength, and skin integrity. This widespread presence in both plant and animal-based foods underscores its importance in a balanced diet. Beta-carotene’s conversion to vitamin A in the body makes it a critical nutrient for maintaining optimal health, particularly in populations with limited access to vitamin A-rich foods. Its presence in diverse culinary preparations highlights its versatility and nutritional significance across different cultural and dietary contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 868, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
