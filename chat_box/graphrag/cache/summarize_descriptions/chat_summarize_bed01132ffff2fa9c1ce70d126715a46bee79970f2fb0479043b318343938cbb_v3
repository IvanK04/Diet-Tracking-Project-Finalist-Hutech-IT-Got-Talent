This category encompasses a variety of dishes and beverages designed to support sustainable weight reduction through mindful eating. Key dishes associated with GIẢM_CÂN include cá rô phi, ức gà không da, cá tuyết chín, cá tuyết chién, lòng xào dưa, gan xào giá, rau khoai lang xào tỏi, rau cải xoong xào tỏi, and gỏi xoài. These meals are typically low in carbohydrates and fat, while maintaining adequate protein content to support satiety and muscle preservation. Additionally, the category includes dishes such as nộm bò kho, which are classified under GIẢM_CÂN due to their low-carb, low-energy, and high-protein profile.  \n\nBeyond specific meals, GIẢM_CÂN also includes a range of beverages and snacks that support weight management. These include nước trà hoa cúc, nước ép dứa, nước chanh leo, and green lemon and honeydew, which are recognized for their low-calorie, nutrient-rich, and vitamin-packed properties—particularly high in vitamin C. These drinks are often consumed as part of a daily routine to promote metabolic health and reduce overall caloric intake.  \n\nThe category is further defined by its focus on balanced nutrition, with an emphasis on whole, minimally processed ingredients that provide essential vitamins and minerals while minimizing empty calories. Dishes like dưa cải hẹ and sữa ngô are included due to their low-calorie and nutrient-balanced consumption profiles, contributing to a diet that supports long-term weight control.  \n\nWhile some descriptions initially refer to GIẢM_CÂN as a \"dietary event\" or \"meal,\" the consistent theme across all sources is that it functions as a structured dietary category or health goal aimed at weight loss. The term is used interchangeably with \"health-related\" or \"dietary\" strategies, but the core purpose remains consistent: to promote body weight reduction through food choices that are low in fat, sugar, and calories, and high in fiber and protein.  \n\nContradictions in terminology—such as labeling it as an \"event\" or \"category\"—are resolved by recognizing that GIẢM_CÂN functions as a comprehensive dietary and health strategy rather than a single event. It is not limited to one type of meal but spans a broad range of dishes and drinks, all aligned with principles of weight management.  \n\nIn summary, GIẢM_CÂN represents a holistic approach to weight loss through the strategic selection of low-calorie, high-fiber, and nutrient-dense foods, including both traditional and modern dishes. It integrates dietary practices with health goals, making it a widely applicable and effective framework for individuals seeking to reduce body weight in a sustainable and balanced manner.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 609, "prompt_tokens": 679, "total_tokens": 1288, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
