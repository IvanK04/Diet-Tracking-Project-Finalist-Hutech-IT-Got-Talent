Potassium plays a key role in regulating blood pressure by counteracting the effects of sodium, helping to keep blood vessels relaxed and reducing the risk of hypertension. In addition to supporting cardiovascular health, potassium contributes to the body’s ability to maintain electrolyte balance, which is crucial for nerve function and muscle contractions. The natural potassium content in cucumber makes it a beneficial addition to a balanced diet, especially for individuals looking to support healthy blood pressure levels and overall fluid regulation. While cucumber is not a high-potassium food by volume, its contribution to daily potassium intake—particularly when consumed as part of a varied diet—can support long-term health. The presence of potassium in cucumber is consistent across multiple sources, with no contradictory information provided. Therefore, the role of potassium in cucumber is well-supported and unified in the available data. This reinforces the idea that cucumber serves as a nutritious, accessible source of this vital mineral, offering health benefits without significant caloric or sodium load. Overall, cucumber stands out as a wholesome, functional food that supports physiological balance through its potassium content.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
