It is present in diverse foods such as Rau cải xoong xào tỏi (pickled mustard greens), guava, papaya, dragon fruit, atiso, mung beans, sweet potatoes (bí đỏ hồ lô), carrots, pumpkin, wheat grain, corn, and pomegranate. These sources collectively highlight fiber’s broad dietary relevance and its significant benefits for gastrointestinal function, including improved digestion and regularity. In particular, high-fiber foods like papaya and dragon fruit are noted for their substantial fiber content, which supports healthy gut function. Similarly, fiber in guava and pomegranate contributes not only to digestive wellness but also to feelings of fullness, aiding in weight management. The presence of fiber in both root vegetables such as carrots and pumpkin, as well as in legumes like mung beans and atiso, underscores its role in maintaining a balanced digestive system and supporting heart health. Additionally, fiber from whole grains such as wheat and corn provides sustained energy and contributes to long-term wellness. The inclusion of fiber in pickled mustard greens and sweet potatoes further demonstrates its versatility across different cuisines and food types. While some descriptions mention fiber in relation to specific health outcomes such as satiety and weight management, these effects are consistently linked to its role in regulating digestion and promoting metabolic balance. Although one description contains a contradictory reference to \"a health-related event\" associated with fiber in atiso and mung beans, this is interpreted as a misstatement; the intended meaning aligns with the well-documented benefits of fiber in supporting digestive wellness and satiety. All provided information converges on a unified conclusion: fiber is a fundamental nutrient found in numerous plant foods, essential for digestive health, satiety, and overall well-being. This comprehensive presence across diverse food sources reinforces its importance in a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
