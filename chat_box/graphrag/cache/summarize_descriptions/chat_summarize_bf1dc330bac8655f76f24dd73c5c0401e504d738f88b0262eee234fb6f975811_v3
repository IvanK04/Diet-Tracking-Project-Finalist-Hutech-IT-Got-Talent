This attribute is commonly found in a wide range of dishes, particularly in Vietnamese cuisine, where it is prevalent in traditional items such as Phở bò tái gầu, Bánh canh sườn heo, Bún ngan măng khô, Bún đậu mắm tôm, lòng lợn, and Bún nem cua bể. It is also present in beverages like Nước ép lê, further demonstrating its broad application across different food types. The gluten-free status is not limited to specific dishes but extends to various ingredients and plant-based foods, including quinoa, mustard greens, whole black beans, cilantro seeds, wood ear mushrooms, boiled soybeans, oatmeal, and long grain white rice. These foods are recognized for their suitability in gluten-sensitive diets due to their natural absence of gluten proteins.\n\nQuinoa and mustard greens are notable examples of foods that share the gluten-free attribute, reinforcing their role in gluten-free meal planning. Similarly, plant-based and vegetarian foods often feature gluten-free properties, making them ideal for individuals managing dietary restrictions. While oatmeal and long grain white rice are generally considered gluten-free, cross-contamination during processing or preparation remains a potential concern and should be acknowledged by consumers. This highlights the importance of checking labels and preparation methods, even when a product is labeled as gluten-free.\n\nThe presence of gluten-free status in both prepared dishes and raw ingredients underscores its significance in modern dietary practices. It serves as a key health feature in many food categories, especially those targeting individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The attribute is consistently described across multiple sources as a health-related category, emphasizing its role in dietary safety and nutritional accessibility. Whether applied to traditional Vietnamese dishes or common pantry staples, the gluten-free designation ensures that a broad spectrum of foods can be safely consumed by those with gluten-related health concerns.\n\nDespite some variations in how the attribute is described—such as its application to specific ingredients or dishes—there is no contradiction in the core definition. All descriptions converge on the central idea that GLUTEN_FREE denotes the absence of gluten, supporting health and dietary needs. The consistency across descriptions confirms that this attribute is both reliable and widely applicable. Therefore, GLUTEN_FREE functions as a foundational element in food labeling and dietary planning, offering safe and accessible options for individuals with gluten-related conditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 918, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
