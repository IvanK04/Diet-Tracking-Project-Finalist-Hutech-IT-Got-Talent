It supports heart health, enhances immune function, and helps maintain cellular integrity. Found in a variety of dietary sources, Vitamin E is present in foods such as rice noodles, ground pork, pears, mangosteen, sticky rice, and sesame seeds, as well as in dark seeds like black sesame. Its antioxidant properties contribute to overall health by reducing cellular stress and preventing damage that can lead to chronic diseases. While the vitamin is widely recognized for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system, it also supports immune function, making it essential for maintaining a robust defense against infections. The presence of Vitamin E in both plant-based and animal-based foods ensures broad dietary accessibility. Although some descriptions mention specific sources like pears and mangosteen, others highlight rice noodles, ground pork, and sticky rice, indicating a diverse range of dietary sources. The Vietnamese description notes its presence in \"dồi huyết\" (a term possibly referring to blood or blood-rich foods) and black sesame seeds, though \"dồi huyết\" is not a standard or widely recognized food source in nutritional literature and may be a translation error or misstatement. This inconsistency is resolved by focusing on well-documented sources such as sesame seeds and common plant-based foods. All descriptions converge on the core functions of Vitamin E: antioxidant activity, protection against oxidative damage, and support for heart and immune health. Therefore, the comprehensive role of Vitamin E is best understood as a vital nutrient that shields cells from damage, promotes cardiovascular wellness, and strengthens the immune system through its presence in a wide array of edible foods. This makes Vitamin E an essential component of a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
