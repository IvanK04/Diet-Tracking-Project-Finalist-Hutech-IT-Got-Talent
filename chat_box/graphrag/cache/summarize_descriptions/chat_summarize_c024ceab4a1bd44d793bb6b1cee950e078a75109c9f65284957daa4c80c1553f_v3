Although one description incorrectly associates bromelain with pandan (dứa), this is a factual inaccuracy, as bromelain is specifically derived from pineapple, not pandan. The enzyme is well recognized for its ability to aid in protein digestion and reduce inflammation, making it beneficial for overall gastrointestinal function and wellness. Its presence in dishes such as mực xào dứa (spiced squid with pandan) may contribute to the dish’s digestive-friendly profile, though the actual source of bromelain in such a dish is likely minimal or absent, as pandan does not contain significant levels of the enzyme. Therefore, any health benefits attributed to bromelain in this context should be understood as stemming from the pineapple component, not the pandan. The enzyme is widely studied and utilized in dietary supplements and natural remedies for its anti-inflammatory and digestive-supporting properties. In summary, bromelain is a naturally occurring enzyme primarily sourced from pineapple, where it supports protein digestion and reduces inflammation, and while it may be referenced in culinary contexts involving pineapple-based dishes, its presence in pandan-based recipes is not substantiated. The accurate identification of bromelain as a pineapple-derived enzyme ensures a scientifically grounded understanding of its role in health and nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 504, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
