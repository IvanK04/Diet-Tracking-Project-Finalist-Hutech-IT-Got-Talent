Found in a wide range of plant-based foods, these substances play a vital role in supporting overall health and well-being. Antioxidants are present in citrus fruits such as oranges, where they protect cells from damage and contribute to immune function. They are also found in green cabbage, paprika, and rambutan, where they help mitigate oxidative stress and support cellular integrity. In addition, compounds like flavonoids in Vietnamese coriander provide protection against oxidative damage and enhance immune function. Notably, betalain, a type of antioxidant, is present in foods such as thunh long and durian, further contributing to their health-promoting properties. These compounds work synergistically to maintain cellular balance and reduce the risk of chronic diseases associated with oxidative damage. While the specific types of antioxidants vary by food source—such as flavonoids, betalains, and other phytochemicals—their core function remains consistent: to protect cells from harmful free radicals. The presence of antioxidants in diverse plant foods underscores their importance in a balanced diet. Collectively, these findings highlight that ANTIOXIDANTS are not only widespread in nature but also essential for maintaining physiological health. Their role in reducing oxidative stress and supporting immune function makes them a critical component of nutritional science. Despite variations in specific compounds across different sources, all descriptions converge on the central theme of cellular protection and health promotion. Thus, ANTIOXIDANTS serve as a fundamental defense mechanism in the body, with their benefits derived from a broad spectrum of dietary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 625, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
