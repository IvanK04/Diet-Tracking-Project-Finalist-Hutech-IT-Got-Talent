This form of chicken is rich in high-quality protein, containing 18.6 grams per 100 grams, and provides essential nutrients such as vitamins B and D, iron, zinc, and selenium. It is described as dark in color, flavorful, and tender, offering a satisfying texture and robust taste. While traditionally associated with higher fat content due to its origin in the thigh section, the removal of bone and skin significantly reduces fat and improves the lean profile, making it a moderate protein source. Compared to chicken drumsticks, chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, contain higher levels of iron and zinc, contributing to its nutritional value, particularly for individuals requiring enhanced mineral intake. Despite being raw, the product retains its natural nutrient composition, with 144 calories per 100 grams, 0 grams of carbohydrates, and 7.92 grams of fat—making it a low-carb, high-protein option suitable for various dietary needs. The removal of bone and skin not only enhances its palatability and ease of preparation but also increases its bioavailability of key minerals like iron and zinc, which are vital for energy production, immune function, and cellular health. Although some sources classify it as a lean meat source, the presence of moderate fat content—particularly in the form of healthy fats—supports overall dietary balance. The nutritional profile aligns with that of a balanced, nutrient-dense food, especially when consumed as part of a varied diet. It is important to note that raw consumption carries potential food safety risks, and proper handling, storage, and cooking are recommended to prevent bacterial contamination. Nonetheless, when properly managed, chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, raw, offer a valuable source of essential nutrients and can be a beneficial component in both dietary planning and meal preparation. The combination of high protein, iron, and zinc content, along with its flavorful and tender characteristics, makes it a preferred choice for health-conscious consumers seeking nutritious, minimally processed meat alternatives. Overall, this product stands out as a well-rounded, nutrient-rich option within the broader category of poultry, providing both functional and sensory benefits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
