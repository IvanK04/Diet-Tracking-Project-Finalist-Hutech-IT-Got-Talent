It is also crucial for maintaining taste and smell. Found in a wide variety of foods, zinc is present in beef, black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, catfish fillet, sunflower seeds, salmon, carp, chicken livers, sticky rice, pears, and mangosteen. Additionally, it is detected in cháo gà (chicken porridge), with a serving containing 3.1 mg of zinc. The mineral supports multiple physiological processes, including immune defense, tissue repair, and metabolic functions. While some descriptions mention zinc's role in reproductive function—such as in \"dồi huyết\" (a type of blood-rich food) and \"hạt vừng đen\" (black sesame seeds)—this function is less consistently emphasized and may be context-specific or regionally referenced. The majority of the evidence points to zinc's primary importance in immune function, wound healing, and metabolic processes. All provided descriptions converge on zinc’s critical role in health, with consistent mentions of its presence in plant-based and animal-based foods. Although some sources list specific food items with varying quantities or additional functions, the core functions of zinc remain unified across the data. Contradictions, such as the mention of reproductive support, are not substantiated by the majority of the descriptions and are therefore not included in the primary summary. The comprehensive presence of zinc in diverse dietary sources underscores its widespread availability and essential nature in human nutrition. Thus, ZINC is a fundamental mineral that contributes significantly to overall health through its involvement in immune regulation, tissue repair, and metabolic enzyme activity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 800, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
