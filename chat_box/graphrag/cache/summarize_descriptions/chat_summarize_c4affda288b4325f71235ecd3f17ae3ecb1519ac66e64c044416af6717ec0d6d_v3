This lifestyle promotes overall health by reducing the intake of artificial additives, preservatives, and unhealthy components commonly found in industrially processed foods. The philosophy behind CLEAN EATING is rooted in the belief that food should be as close as possible to its natural state—such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats—thereby supporting bodily function and long-term well-being. While it is often described as a dietary condition, it is more accurately characterized as a conscious dietary goal or lifestyle choice rather than a medical diagnosis. CLEAN EATING encourages individuals to be mindful of food sources, ingredient transparency, and nutritional quality, fostering greater awareness of what they consume. The emphasis on simplicity and purity in food preparation aligns with broader wellness trends that prioritize prevention, sustainability, and holistic health. Though some may interpret CLEAN EATING as a strict regimen, it is generally flexible and adaptable to individual needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds. It does not prescribe specific meal plans or eliminate entire food groups but instead promotes intentional eating habits. Contradictions in the original descriptions—such as labeling it a \"condition\" versus a \"goal\"—are resolved by recognizing that CLEAN EATING is not a medical condition but a health-oriented lifestyle objective. Therefore, it is best understood as a proactive dietary goal aimed at improving health through the consumption of minimally processed, whole, and nutrient-dense foods. This approach supports better digestion, increased energy, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. CLEAN EATING also encourages the avoidance of synthetic ingredients, excessive sugar, and refined grains, while promoting the inclusion of plant-based, unprocessed foods. Ultimately, CLEAN EATING serves as a guiding principle for individuals seeking to align their eating habits with natural, sustainable, and health-promoting values.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 556, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
