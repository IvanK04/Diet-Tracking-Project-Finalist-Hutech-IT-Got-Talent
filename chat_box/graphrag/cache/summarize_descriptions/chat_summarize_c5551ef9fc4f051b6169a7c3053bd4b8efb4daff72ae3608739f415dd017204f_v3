It plays a critical role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, which are vital for protein synthesis and the production of important biological molecules. Additionally, molybdenum is involved in detoxification pathways, helping the body neutralize harmful substances and maintain metabolic balance.\n\nThis mineral is naturally present in a variety of common foods, including leafy greens like kale and green cabbage, legumes, grains, and certain vegetables such as celery, green peas, mushrooms, cucumber, and tomatoes. It is also found in smaller amounts in papaya, rice, eggs, and chicken wings. These dietary sources contribute to the body’s daily requirement of molybdenum, which is typically consumed in trace amounts due to its low concentration in food.\n\nThe presence of molybdenum in diverse food groups—ranging from plant-based sources like leafy greens and legumes to animal-based sources such as eggs and poultry—demonstrates its widespread availability in the human diet. Its involvement in both enzyme function and detoxification processes underscores its importance in maintaining overall metabolic health and cellular function. While the exact concentration varies by food, the consistent mention across multiple sources confirms that molybdenum is a broadly distributed trace mineral in both plant and animal foods.\n\nAlthough some descriptions mention specific foods with slight variations in detail, such as kale, celery, and green peas, there are no contradictory claims regarding molybdenum’s biological functions or dietary sources. All descriptions converge on the core roles of molybdenum in enzyme activity, sulfur amino acid metabolism, and detoxification. Minor inconsistencies in phrasing—such as the inclusion of \"tomato\" or \"papaya\" in some entries—do not contradict the broader consensus but rather expand the range of dietary sources.\n\nIn summary, molybdenum is a trace mineral found in a wide array of foods, including leafy greens, legumes, grains, vegetables like celery, cucumbers, and tomatoes, as well as animal products such as eggs and chicken. It supports essential metabolic functions by aiding in the activity of key enzymes and facilitating the breakdown and detoxification of sulfur-containing compounds. Its presence in both plant and animal-based diets ensures that individuals can obtain this vital nutrient through a balanced, varied diet. Despite its low concentration in food, molybdenum plays a significant role in maintaining physiological balance and supporting overall health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 523, "prompt_tokens": 401, "total_tokens": 924, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
