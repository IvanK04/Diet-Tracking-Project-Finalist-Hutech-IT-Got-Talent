It plays a crucial role in red blood cell formation, energy production, and overall bodily function, supporting cognitive performance and general well-being. Found in a wide variety of foods, including beef, pork ears, chicken livers, black beans, almonds, bean sprouts, sunflower seeds, salmon, carp, whole wheat flour, sticky rice, tamarind sauce, wonton noodles, catfish fillet, and even plant-based dishes like cháo gà, cai chi p xao nham, and Nộm bò khô, iron contributes significantly to blood health. Specific servings contain varying amounts: cháo gà provides 11.8mg, cai chi p xao nham contains 12.3mg, and Nộm bò khô has 2.7mg per serving, while other dishes such as pear and mangosteen contain 3.7mg and 4.6mg respectively. Iron is particularly important in plant-based diets, where it supports nutritional balance and helps prevent iron deficiency. Its presence in both animal and plant sources underscores its broad dietary relevance. Although some descriptions mention iron in fruits like pears and mangosteen, the quantities are relatively low, indicating a supportive rather than primary role. The mineral is consistently linked to the prevention of anemia and the maintenance of energy levels and cognitive function. In traditional dishes such as Nộm bò khô and sticky rice, iron contributes to red blood cell formation and oxygen transport, reinforcing its role in daily health. The presence of iron in chicken livers and black beans highlights its importance in both animal and plant-based nutrition. Despite minor discrepancies in reported quantities, all descriptions converge on iron’s fundamental biological function: enabling efficient oxygen delivery throughout the body and supporting overall vitality. Thus, IRON remains a cornerstone nutrient across diverse cuisines and dietary patterns.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 704, "total_tokens": 1103, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
