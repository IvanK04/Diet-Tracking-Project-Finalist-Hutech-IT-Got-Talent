It is a foundational ingredient in many culinary traditions, particularly in Vietnamese cuisine, where it plays a key role in enhancing the savory profile of a wide range of dishes. Garlic is widely used in traditional Vietnamese recipes such as cá thu chén, cá trê chén, thịt lợn xá xíu, thịt bò khô, and nước hầm xương bò, where it contributes depth and complexity to the flavor. While it is often used in raw or minimally cooked forms, its sharp taste mellows into a sweeter, milder flavor when roasted or stewed, allowing it to complement other ingredients without overpowering them.\n\nBotanically, garlic is a bulbous plant that contains sulfur compounds, most notably allicin, which is released when the garlic is crushed or chopped. This compound is responsible for its distinctive aroma and is believed to offer various health benefits, including antimicrobial and cardiovascular support. Although garlic is often grouped with other Allium members such as onions and shallots, it stands out for its intensity and versatility in both seasoning and flavor development.\n\nIn Vietnamese cooking, garlic is not only a flavor enhancer but also a key component in building the rich, savory character of dishes. It is frequently used in sauces, stir-fries, braised meats, and broths, where it adds a robustness that balances the dish’s other elements. Its use in dishes like nước hầm xương bò (beef bone broth) and thịt lợn xá xíu (pork xá xíu) highlights its role in creating depth and umami, essential qualities in traditional cuisine.\n\nDespite some descriptions referring to garlic as a \"spice,\" it is more accurately classified as a plant or herb used in cooking. It is low in calories and valued for its natural compounds, which contribute to both culinary and potential health benefits. While some sources note its presence in the context of shallots and other condiments, garlic remains distinct in its flavor profile and functional role in the kitchen.\n\nOverall, garlic is a versatile, essential ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine and beyond. Its combination of strong aroma, flavor depth, and health-promoting compounds makes it a cornerstone of global and regional cooking. In Vietnam, it is a common and indispensable component in both everyday meals and traditional recipes, contributing to the authenticity and complexity of the culinary experience.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 502, "prompt_tokens": 552, "total_tokens": 1054, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
