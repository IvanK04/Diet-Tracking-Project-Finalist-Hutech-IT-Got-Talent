It plays a critical role in cell growth and differentiation, contributing to overall cellular health. Found in both animal and plant sources, VITAMIN_A is particularly abundant in animal products such as chicken livers, where it is present in high concentrations. Plant-based sources include carrots, sweet potatoes, black beans, almonds, and bơ tươi (fresh coconut oil), which also contribute to its dietary intake. While the vitamin is vital for normal physiological functions, its fat-soluble nature means it is stored in the body’s fatty tissues and liver, and excessive intake can lead to toxicity. VITAMIN_A is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the development of epithelial tissues, making it indispensable for maintaining healthy skin, mucous membranes, and the immune system. Although it is commonly associated with night vision due to its role in the production of rhodopsin, its benefits extend to immune defense and tissue repair. The vitamin exists in two main forms: preformed vitamin A (retinol) found in animal products, and provitamin A (carotenoids) such as beta-carotene, which is converted to retinol in the body and is found in plant sources like carrots and sweet potatoes. Despite variations in dietary sources, all descriptions converge on the core functions of VITAMIN_A in vision, immune health, and cellular development. Contradictions in the descriptions—such as the mention of bơ tươi as a source—are resolved by recognizing that while bơ tươi may contain trace amounts of vitamin A, it is not a primary or well-documented source; the more reliable and consistent sources are animal products like chicken liver and plant sources like carrots and sweet potatoes. Therefore, the comprehensive role of VITAMIN_A remains firmly rooted in its biological functions and its presence across diverse dietary sources. This makes it a crucial nutrient for human health, especially in populations with limited access to balanced diets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 416, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 680, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
