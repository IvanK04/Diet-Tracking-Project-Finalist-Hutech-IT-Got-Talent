It is primarily made from tapioca, which gives it a soft, chewy texture and a neutral flavor profile. This characteristic makes it ideal for adding both texture and a subtle sweetness to the dish without overpowering other ingredients. While it is often associated with sweet dairy-based desserts like kem sữa chua trân châu, its versatility allows it to be incorporated into a variety of traditional Vietnamese beverages and confections. The jelly's structure provides a satisfying mouthfeel, enhancing the overall sensory experience of the dish. Despite its simple composition, TRÂN CHÂU TRẮNG plays a key role in balancing the richness of dairy and the freshness of fruit in these desserts. Its neutral taste ensures that it complements rather than dominates the flavor, allowing other components to shine. The use of tapioca as the primary ingredient also contributes to its firm yet pliable consistency, which is essential for maintaining shape during preparation and consumption. Overall, TRÂN CHÂU TRẮNG is a foundational element in many Vietnamese sweet treats, valued for its texture, flavor neutrality, and adaptability across different culinary applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 469, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
