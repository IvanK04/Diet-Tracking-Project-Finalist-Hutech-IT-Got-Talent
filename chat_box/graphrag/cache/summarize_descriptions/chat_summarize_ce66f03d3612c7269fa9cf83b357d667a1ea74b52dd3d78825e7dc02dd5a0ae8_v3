It plays a central role in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a vital molecule involved in numerous biochemical pathways, including energy metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol production. Pantothenic acid is widely distributed in a variety of dietary sources, including bơ tươi (fresh coconut oil), black beans, bean sprouts, chicken livers, sunflower seeds, and carp. Its presence in these foods underscores its broad availability across different food groups. The vitamin is particularly important for the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, supporting both energy generation and the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. While it is commonly found in plant-based foods such as beans and sprouts, it is also present in animal-derived sources like chicken livers, highlighting its universal presence in the diet. Despite variations in food sources mentioned across descriptions, all consistently emphasize its critical role in coenzyme A production and metabolic function. There are no contradictory claims regarding its biological function or dietary sources; rather, the descriptions converge on a unified understanding of pantothenic acid as a fundamental nutrient for energy metabolism and biochemical synthesis. The vitamin is not only essential for maintaining metabolic balance but also supports overall cellular function due to its involvement in key enzymatic reactions. Although the specific foods listed vary, the underlying scientific consensus remains consistent: pantothenic acid is indispensable for the body’s ability to convert nutrients into usable energy and to synthesize vital molecules such as fatty acids. Its widespread presence in both plant and animal foods ensures that it is generally accessible in a balanced diet. In summary, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a vital B-vitamin that enables the body to efficiently metabolize fats and carbohydrates through the formation of coenzyme A, making it a cornerstone of energy production and metabolic health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
