These fatty acids are recognized for their significant health benefits, particularly in supporting cardiovascular health and brain function. OMEGA-3 plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy heart rhythms, which contributes to overall cardiovascular well-being. Additionally, its impact on the nervous system supports cognitive function and mental health. The presence of OMEGA-3 in fish such as carp and mullet, as well as in more commonly known species like cod and tilapia, underscores its widespread availability in dietary sources. While some descriptions mention specific varieties like \"ca thu chen\" and \"ca tre chen,\" these appear to be regional or local names for carp and mullet, which align with the broader classification of these fish species. There is no contradiction among the descriptions; rather, they consistently emphasize OMEGA-3’s role in supporting heart and brain health, with minor variations in fish examples that reflect regional naming conventions. All sources agree on the essential nature of OMEGA-3 as a fatty acid and its positive effects on human health. Therefore, OMEGA-3 stands as a key nutrient in balanced diets, especially for individuals seeking to improve cardiovascular and neurological health through natural, food-based sources. Its presence in commonly consumed fish makes it accessible and practical for global populations. The scientific consensus across the provided descriptions supports the inclusion of OMEGA-3-rich fish in dietary recommendations for long-term wellness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 329, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
