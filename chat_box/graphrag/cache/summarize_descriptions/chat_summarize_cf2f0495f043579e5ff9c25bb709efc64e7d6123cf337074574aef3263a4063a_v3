It plays a central role in energy metabolism and is critically involved in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a vital molecule that participates in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to generate cellular energy. Coenzyme A is also essential for fatty acid synthesis, making pantothenic acid a key player in both energy production and lipid metabolism.  \n\nThis vitamin is widely distributed in a variety of dietary sources, including spinach, peanut butter, fish, seeds, pork belly, shallots, brown sugar, and sunflower oil. Its presence in such diverse foods underscores its broad availability in the human diet. While some sources highlight spinach and peanut butter as key dietary sources, others emphasize fish, seeds, pork belly, and shallots, indicating that pantothenic acid is not confined to a single food group. The inclusion of brown sugar and sunflower oil further expands the range of foods where this vitamin can be found, suggesting that it is accessible through both plant-based and animal-based diets.  \n\nDespite variations in the specific food examples cited across descriptions, there is no contradiction in the core biological functions or dietary sources of pantothenic acid. All descriptions consistently affirm its role in coenzyme A synthesis and energy metabolism, reinforcing its fundamental importance in cellular function. The slight variation in food examples—such as spinach, peanut butter, fish, seeds, pork belly, shallots, brown sugar, and sunflower oil—reflects the vitamin’s widespread presence in both common and less commonly recognized foods, enhancing dietary diversity and accessibility.  \n\nPantothenic acid is considered essential for human health, as the body cannot synthesize it in sufficient quantities and must obtain it through diet. Its involvement in the synthesis of coenzyme A makes it indispensable for metabolic pathways that sustain life, including the oxidation of fatty acids and the metabolism of carbohydrates. Additionally, its role in fatty acid synthesis supports the production of essential lipids necessary for cell membrane integrity and signaling.  \n\nAlthough the vitamin is often present in small amounts in many foods, its broad dietary distribution ensures that most individuals can meet their daily requirements through a balanced diet. There is no evidence suggesting deficiency in typical dietary patterns, and the vitamin is generally regarded as safe and non-toxic even in higher-than-recommended doses.  \n\nIn summary, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a vital B-vitamin involved in energy metabolism and the synthesis of coenzyme A. It is found in a wide array of foods, including plant-based sources like spinach, peanut butter, brown sugar, and sunflower oil, as well as animal-based sources such as fish, seeds, pork belly, and shallots. Its essential role in metabolic processes and its widespread presence in the diet make it a fundamental component of human nutrition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 591, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 915, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
