It is essential for brain development and function, contributing to the production of key neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA, which regulate mood, sleep, and cognitive performance. This nutrient supports both neurological and metabolic health, making it indispensable for overall well-being.\n\nVitamin B6 is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including animal and plant-based foods. It is found in meats such as chicken breast and chicken wings, as well as in plant-based options like garlic, cucumber, lemon, cinnamon, kale, green cabbage, amaranth, edamame, and leafy greens. Additionally, it is present in tomatoes and other citrus fruits, further expanding its availability in diverse diets. These food sources ensure that individuals can obtain adequate levels of Vitamin B6 through a balanced and varied diet.\n\nThe vitamin's involvement in amino acid metabolism is fundamental to protein breakdown and utilization, supporting energy production and the synthesis of other vital compounds. Its role in immune function helps maintain a robust defense system, protecting the body against infections and inflammation. Furthermore, Vitamin B6 contributes to brain health by facilitating the proper development and function of the central nervous system, particularly during critical developmental stages.\n\nWhile the descriptions highlight multiple food sources, there is no contradiction in the information provided—each source consistently reinforces the vitamin’s importance in metabolism, brain function, and immune support. The variation in food examples reflects the broad dietary range in which Vitamin B6 can be obtained, emphasizing its accessibility and nutritional versatility.\n\nIn summary, Vitamin B6 is a critical nutrient that supports brain development and function, neurotransmitter production, amino acid metabolism, and immune health. It is naturally present in a wide array of foods, including meats, leafy greens, citrus fruits, legumes, and various vegetables, making it a key component of a balanced diet. Its multifaceted roles underscore its significance in maintaining optimal physical and mental health across different life stages.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 420, "prompt_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 797, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
