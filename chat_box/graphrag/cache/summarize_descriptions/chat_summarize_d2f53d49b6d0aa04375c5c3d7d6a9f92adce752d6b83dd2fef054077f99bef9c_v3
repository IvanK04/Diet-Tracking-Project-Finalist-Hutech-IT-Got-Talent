It is essential for energy metabolism, supporting the conversion of food into usable energy through the function of key metabolic pathways. Additionally, Vitamin B3 contributes to the proper functioning of the nervous system, helping maintain neural health and cognitive performance. It also plays a critical role in blood formation by aiding in the production of red blood cells, which ensures adequate oxygen transport throughout the body. Found naturally in a variety of foods, including sticky rice, Vitamin B3 serves as a source of antioxidants, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. This antioxidant property supports overall cellular health and contributes to cardiovascular well-being, with evidence suggesting that adequate intake may promote heart health by improving cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation. While the primary sources of Vitamin B3 include whole grains, meat, and certain vegetables, its presence in sticky rice highlights its dietary accessibility in certain regions. Despite some variations in dietary sources, the consistent role of Vitamin B3 across biological systems underscores its importance in maintaining metabolic balance and supporting vital bodily functions. The combined evidence from scientific research and nutritional data confirms that Vitamin B3 is not only a key player in energy production but also a protective agent against cellular damage and a contributor to cardiovascular and neurological health. Therefore, maintaining sufficient levels of Vitamin B3 through a balanced diet is recommended for optimal health outcomes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
