This category is commonly applied to a variety of foods, including vegetables, legumes, and specific dishes such as Bánh canh sườn heo. The presence of high potassium content in these items is recognized as a key nutritional feature, often labeled as a health tag within dietary databases and nutritional assessments. HIGH_POTASSIUM is not merely a descriptive label but a functional indicator of the physiological benefits associated with potassium intake.  \n\nPotassium plays a vital role in maintaining proper cardiovascular and muscular function. Foods categorized under HIGH_POTASSIUM support heart health by helping to regulate blood pressure and maintain normal heart rhythm. Additionally, potassium contributes to the proper functioning of skeletal and smooth muscles, aiding in muscle contraction and relaxation. These benefits are particularly relevant for individuals managing conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmias, or muscle weakness.  \n\nThe attribute is consistently described across multiple sources as indicating a high concentration of potassium, which is essential for overall metabolic balance. While the specific dishes may vary, the underlying nutritional principle remains consistent: high potassium content provides measurable health advantages. The inclusion of both traditional dishes like Bánh canh sườn heo and plant-based foods such as vegetables and legumes demonstrates the broad applicability of the HIGH_POTASSIUM category across different cuisines and food groups.  \n\nDespite minor variations in phrasing—such as whether the benefit is described as \"supporting\" or \"beneficial for\" heart and muscle function—there is no contradiction in the core message. All descriptions converge on the same central idea: high potassium content is a positive health attribute linked to improved cardiovascular and muscular health. The repeated emphasis on potassium’s role in supporting heart and muscle function confirms the consistency and reliability of this classification.  \n\nIn summary, HIGH_POTASSIUM serves as a comprehensive health and dietary indicator, identifying foods rich in potassium that contribute to essential bodily functions. It is used both in nutritional labeling and health recommendations, providing consumers and healthcare professionals with clear information about the benefits of potassium-rich diets. Whether applied to a traditional Vietnamese dish or a common vegetable, the HIGH_POTASSIUM designation reflects a scientifically supported nutritional value. This attribute enables better dietary planning, especially for individuals with specific health needs, and promotes awareness of the importance of balanced mineral intake.  \n\nBy integrating information from all provided descriptions, the final summary presents a unified, evidence-based understanding of HIGH_POTASSIUM as a meaningful and beneficial health tag in nutritional science and dietary practice.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 526, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 776, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
