This attribute is commonly found in Vietnamese cuisine and is particularly relevant for individuals with dairy allergies or those following specific dietary restrictions. The term serves as a health tag, signaling that the dish is safe for consumption by people who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy, or adhering to dairy-free lifestyles. \n\nExamples of dishes labeled as dairy-free include Phở bò tái gầu, Bánh canh sườn heo, xôi, xôi xéo, Nước ép lê, Bún ngan măng khô, Bún đậu mắm tôm, lòng lợn, and Bún nem cua bể. While xôi xéo contains pork and is not suitable for vegetarians, its dairy-free status remains valid, highlighting that the absence of dairy does not necessarily imply vegetarianism. This distinction is important for consumers seeking specific dietary accommodations. \n\nThe DAIRY_FREE designation is consistently applied across various dishes, demonstrating its widespread use in both traditional and modern Vietnamese food offerings. It functions not only as a nutritional label but also as a key component in food safety and allergen management. The inclusion of diverse dishes—ranging from soups and rice-based meals to beverages and noodle dishes—underscores the adaptability and relevance of the dairy-free category within the culinary landscape. \n\nDespite some potential contradictions in the descriptions—such as the inclusion of pork-containing dishes like xôi xéo under the dairy-free label—these inconsistencies are resolved by recognizing that the DAIRY_FREE attribute specifically refers to the absence of dairy, not the presence or absence of meat or vegetarian suitability. Therefore, a dish may be dairy-free while still containing animal proteins, making it appropriate for those avoiding dairy but not necessarily for vegetarians. \n\nIn summary, DAIRY_FREE is a clear, consistent, and essential health-related category in Vietnamese cuisine, used to identify food items that do not contain any dairy products. It supports dietary needs and allergen awareness, ensuring safer and more inclusive food options. The category is applied across a broad range of dishes, from simple rice dishes to complex soups and beverages, and is recognized as a reliable indicator of dairy absence. Its presence in both traditional and contemporary menus reflects its growing importance in modern food labeling and consumer health practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 487, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 817, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
