This category encompasses a wide range of dishes intended to meet the nutritional needs of individuals seeking to increase their body weight. Dishes such as Stir-fried Maize Seeds with Small Shrimp, Vịt rang (roasted duck), Cá rô phi rán (grilled catfish), thịt lợn xá xíu (pork xá xíu), Nộm hoa chuối thịt gà (pork and banana leaf salad), Gỏi ngó sen (lotus root and pork salad), Xôi trắng (white sticky rice), Mỳ vằn thắn (spicy noodles), Cơm rang thập cẩm (mixed rice with various ingredients), da heo (pork skin), and sunflower seeds are all classified under TĂNG_CÂN due to their high-calorie, high-protein, and high-carbohydrate profiles. The category also includes Hủ tiếu thịt bằm (pork minced noodle soup), which is noted for its inclusion of red meat and eggs, further enhancing its nutritional value for weight gain.  \n\nThe primary purpose of TĂNG_CÂN is to provide meals that are energy-dense and nutrient-rich, making them suitable for individuals with weight gain goals. These dishes are formulated to deliver substantial amounts of macronutrients—particularly protein and fats—essential for muscle and tissue development. The inclusion of red meat, eggs, and high-fat ingredients like pork skin and sunflower seeds underscores the category’s focus on fat and protein content. Additionally, the presence of carbohydrates in dishes such as rice, noodles, and mixed rice dishes ensures sustained energy levels throughout the day.  \n\nTĂNG_CÂN is not merely a passive label but an active dietary strategy, often applied in meal planning contexts where weight gain is a specific objective. It functions both as a meal category and a dietary event, indicating structured, high-nutrient meals designed to promote healthy weight gain. The consistency across descriptions confirms that all listed dishes fall under this category due to their nutritional composition and intended use. While some descriptions initially refer to it as a \"dietary event\" or \"event category,\" these are contextual variations of the same core concept—meals designed to support weight gain. There are no contradictory elements in the data; all descriptions align in emphasizing the high-calorie, high-protein, and high-carbohydrate nature of the dishes.  \n\nIn summary, TĂNG_CÂN represents a comprehensive dietary classification for meals and dishes that are specifically engineered to support weight gain through balanced, nutrient-dense ingredients. It is widely applicable across various Vietnamese dishes, reflecting a well-established culinary and nutritional approach to addressing weight gain needs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 576, "prompt_tokens": 620, "total_tokens": 1196, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
