This attribute is commonly associated with specific Vietnamese dishes such as Rau khoai lang xào tỏi and Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, which are prepared with minimal fat and designed to promote healthy eating habits. The inclusion of LOW_FAT in the health tags of dishes like Bánh tráng trộn further underscores its role in identifying meals that align with cardiovascular wellness and weight management goals. These dishes typically feature fresh vegetables, light seasonings, and minimal oil use, contributing to their low-fat profile. The consistent use of LOW_FAT across various menu items suggests a deliberate effort by culinary practices to offer nutritious, balanced options that support overall well-being. While the exact fat content may vary slightly depending on preparation methods, the overarching intent of the LOW_FAT designation remains focused on reducing saturated and total fat intake, which is known to lower the risk of heart disease and support healthy body composition. The tag serves not only as a nutritional indicator but also as a guide for consumers making health-conscious food choices. It is important to note that the low-fat designation does not imply the absence of fat, but rather a controlled and moderate amount that fits within recommended dietary guidelines. In the context of traditional Vietnamese cuisine, where flavor is often derived from herbs and spices rather than heavy oils, the LOW_FAT attribute aligns naturally with the existing culinary style. This makes it a valuable tool for both health professionals and consumers aiming to maintain a balanced diet. Overall, LOW_FAT functions as a clear, accessible label that communicates the health benefits of specific dishes, promoting awareness and encouraging healthier eating patterns. The presence of this tag across diverse dishes such as Rau khoai lang xào tỏi, Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, and Bánh tráng trộn demonstrates its versatility and relevance in both everyday meals and health-focused meal planning. By emphasizing low fat content, these dishes contribute to a broader dietary strategy that supports long-term health outcomes, including reduced risk of obesity and improved lipid profiles. Thus, LOW_FAT is not merely a technical label but a meaningful indicator of a dish’s nutritional value and its potential to support a healthy lifestyle.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 469, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 693, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
