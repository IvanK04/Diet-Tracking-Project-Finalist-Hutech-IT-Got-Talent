It plays a critical role in energy production and contributes to the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and nails. Found in a variety of dietary sources, biotin is naturally present in foods such as pears, mangosteen, and sticky rice. These foods serve as important dietary contributors to biotin intake, supporting its physiological functions in the body. While biotin is commonly associated with promoting skin, hair, and nail health, its broader metabolic functions underscore its importance in overall cellular energy processes. The consistent emphasis across the provided descriptions on biotin’s role in skin, hair, and nail health, as well as its involvement in metabolic pathways, confirms its multifaceted biological significance. Although some descriptions mention specific food sources with slight variations in phrasing—such as \"pear and mangosteen\" versus \"pears and mangosteen\"—these differences do not introduce contradiction, as they reflect minor textual variations rather than conflicting information. All sources agree on biotin’s primary functions and its presence in plant-based foods. Therefore, the summary reflects a unified and coherent understanding of biotin as a vital nutrient with both structural and metabolic roles. Biotin deficiency is rare due to its widespread availability in the diet, but it can occur in individuals with certain medical conditions or those taking specific medications that interfere with its absorption. Nonetheless, dietary inclusion of biotin-rich foods like pears, mangosteen, and sticky rice remains a recommended strategy for maintaining optimal health. In conclusion, biotin is a fundamental component of human nutrition, supporting not only the integrity of skin, hair, and nails but also the efficient metabolism of macronutrients and the generation of cellular energy. Its presence in common fruits and grains makes it accessible and essential for a balanced diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 393, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 659, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
