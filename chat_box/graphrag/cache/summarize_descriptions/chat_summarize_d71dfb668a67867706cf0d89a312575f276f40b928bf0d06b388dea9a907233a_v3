Classified as a cereal, corn is widely used in food products due to its nutritional profile, which includes low calories, low fat, and moderate carbohydrates. It is a common component in a variety of processed and prepared foods. In its fresh form, corn is consumed as a vegetable, with juicy kernels arranged in rows along the cob, offering a sweet, flavorful texture. This form of corn provides essential energy and contains beneficial antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health and overall well-being. The dual nature of corn—functioning as both a grain and a vegetable—highlights its adaptability across culinary traditions and food systems. Whether used in processed products or eaten fresh, corn remains a fundamental part of global diets. Its nutritional value and widespread cultivation underscore its importance in agriculture and nutrition. While some sources emphasize its classification as a cereal, the presence of sweet kernels and its consumption as a vegetable confirms its role as a plant-based food with both grain and vegetable characteristics. This integration of functions reflects the complexity and utility of corn in human diets. The crop's ability to provide energy, antioxidants, and dietary fiber makes it a valuable component of balanced nutrition. Overall, corn stands out as a nutritionally significant and widely utilized food, combining the benefits of a low-calorie, low-fat grain with the health-promoting properties of a sweet vegetable.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
