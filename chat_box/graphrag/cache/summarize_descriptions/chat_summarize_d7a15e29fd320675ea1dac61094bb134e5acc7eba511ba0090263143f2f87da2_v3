It functions both as a primary ingredient and as a seasoning, often adding a rich, nutty flavor and contributing to the dish's texture. Lạc rang is particularly valued for its high protein and vitamin content, making it a nutritious component in many traditional meals. As a snack or condiment, it is frequently consumed on its own or incorporated into mixed dishes to enhance taste and dietary value. However, a significant consideration associated with lạc rang is its status as a common allergen. The ingredient is derived from peanuts, and individuals with peanut allergies are at risk of experiencing allergic reactions upon consumption. This allergenic property necessitates caution, especially in households or dining environments where peanut sensitivity is present. Despite its culinary benefits, the presence of peanuts in lạc rang means that it should be avoided or carefully managed by those with known peanut allergies. The consistency of this information across multiple descriptions confirms that lạc rang is consistently identified as a peanut-based product with both nutritional and allergenic implications. There are no contradictory elements in the provided descriptions; all sources align in identifying lạc rang as a peanut-containing food item used in both main dishes and as a snack. Its role in enhancing flavor and nutritional profile is well established, while its allergenic nature is clearly emphasized. Therefore, the comprehensive description of Lạc rang reflects its versatility in Vietnamese cuisine, its nutritional benefits, and the critical health consideration of peanut allergy. This makes it a popular yet potentially risky ingredient depending on the consumer’s dietary needs. In summary, Lạc rang is a staple in many traditional Vietnamese dishes, valued for its flavor and nutritional content, but it must be consumed with awareness due to its allergenic properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 622, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
