It improves insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to more effectively utilize glucose from the bloodstream, which is particularly beneficial for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. Chromium supports carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, contributing to overall metabolic balance. This mineral is naturally present in certain foods, including sticky rice, and is considered essential for proper metabolic function. While the exact dietary requirements and optimal intake levels may vary among individuals, chromium's role in insulin regulation underscores its importance in managing blood glucose, especially in conditions related to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. The multiple descriptions provided consistently emphasize chromium’s function in insulin enhancement and metabolic regulation, with no contradictory information. Therefore, the unified summary reflects a clear and coherent understanding of chromium’s physiological role. The mineral is not a primary source of energy but acts as a cofactor in metabolic pathways, supporting the body’s ability to process carbohydrates and fats efficiently. Its presence in foods like sticky rice highlights its dietary relevance, though it is not the sole contributor to blood sugar control. Overall, chromium is recognized as a key trace mineral in maintaining metabolic health and supporting glucose homeostasis.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
