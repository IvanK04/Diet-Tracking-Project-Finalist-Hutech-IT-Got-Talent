This attribute is particularly notable in certain foods, such as green cabbage, which is recognized for its substantial vitamin C content. The presence of high vitamin C in green cabbage contributes to enhanced immune defense mechanisms and helps neutralize harmful free radicals, thereby promoting overall cellular health. As a result, consuming foods with HIGH_VITAMIN_C content, like green cabbage, can support the body’s natural ability to resist infections and maintain optimal immune function. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C also play a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress, which is linked to chronic diseases and aging. While the specific food source of HIGH_VITAMIN_C is not universally defined, green cabbage stands out as a prominent example due to its well-documented levels of this essential vitamin. This makes it a valuable component of a balanced diet focused on immune health and disease prevention. The benefits associated with HIGH_VITAMIN_C are not limited to green cabbage; the tag broadly applies to any food or dietary component rich in vitamin C, emphasizing its importance across various nutritional contexts. However, the primary illustrative example provided in the data underscores green cabbage as a practical and accessible source of this nutrient. In summary, HIGH_VITAMIN_C represents a key nutritional feature that supports immune resilience and cellular protection, with green cabbage serving as a notable dietary source that embodies these benefits.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
