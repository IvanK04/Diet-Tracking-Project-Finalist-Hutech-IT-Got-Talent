It supports the body’s ability to produce hemoglobin, ensuring efficient oxygen transport in the bloodstream, and helps neutralize harmful free radicals through its involvement in antioxidant systems. Copper also contributes to energy production and enzyme function, supporting overall cellular metabolism. Found in a wide variety of dietary sources, copper is present in meats such as pork chop, chicken wings, and fish fillets, as well as in plant-based foods including leafy greens like kale and green cabbage, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. It is also detectable in fruits and vegetables such as coconut, mango, cucumber, and tomato, where it supports metabolic and immune health. Additionally, copper is present in dietary fats like coconut oil and sunflower oil, as well as in spices such as cinnamon and lemon, and in foods like brown sugar. While copper is not required in large quantities due to its trace mineral status, its presence in diverse foods underscores its importance in maintaining physiological balance. The mineral’s role extends beyond red blood cell formation to include immune system support and the proper functioning of key enzymes involved in energy metabolism. Although some descriptions mention copper’s presence in specific foods like squid and grouper, these are consistent with broader patterns of dietary distribution. There are no contradictory claims regarding copper’s primary functions—its involvement in red blood cell formation, antioxidant defense, and metabolic processes is uniformly reported across all descriptions. Minor variations in food sources do not alter the core biological roles of copper. Overall, copper is a vital micronutrient that contributes to multiple aspects of health, and its availability through a balanced diet ensures optimal physiological function. Its presence in both animal and plant-based foods makes it accessible to a wide range of dietary patterns. Therefore, adequate dietary intake of copper, derived from sources such as fish, nuts, legumes, leafy greens, and certain fruits and oils, is essential for maintaining healthy red blood cell production, supporting immune function, and protecting against oxidative stress.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 533, "total_tokens": 957, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
