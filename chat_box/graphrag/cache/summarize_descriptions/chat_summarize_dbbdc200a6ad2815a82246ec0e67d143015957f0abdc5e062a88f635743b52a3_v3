It plays a crucial role in maintaining skeletal strength, supporting muscle contraction, and ensuring proper nerve function. Found in a wide variety of foods, calcium is present in dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, as well as in fish like sea bass and scallops, and in plant-based sources including leafy greens (such as turnip greens and spinach), fortified foods, tofu, soybeans, and fortified cereals. It is also found in vegetables like asparagus, egg noodles, parsnips, chili peppers, shallots, ridge gourd, artichokes, and cai xoong. Additionally, calcium is present in legumes, nuts, and certain herbs such as ngò rí, tía tô, kinh giới, and ngò tây. Notably, it is found in less conventional sources such as glass noodles, red cabbage, beef, pork ears, tapioca flour, Vietnamese balm, young coconut squares, and even peanut butter. While calcium is vital for bone development and metabolic balance, its presence in diverse food groups underscores its broad dietary availability. Although some descriptions mention specific sources like dill or dill-based products, the primary emphasis remains on calcium’s critical physiological functions and its widespread presence across both animal and plant-based foods. Contradictions in source specificity (e.g., glass noodles and red cabbage being listed as sources) are resolved by recognizing that while these foods contain calcium, they are not primary dietary sources compared to dairy and leafy greens. The consistent theme across all descriptions is calcium’s fundamental role in human health, particularly in supporting skeletal integrity, muscle activity, and nerve signaling.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 757, "total_tokens": 1112, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
