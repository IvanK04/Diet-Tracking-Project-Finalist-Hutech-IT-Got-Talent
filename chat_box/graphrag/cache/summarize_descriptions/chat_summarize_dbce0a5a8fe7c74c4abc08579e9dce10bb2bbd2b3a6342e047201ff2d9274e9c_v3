The dish typically features rice noodles, often referred to as bánh phở, which are served in a savory broth seasoned with garlic, onion, and lime, enhancing both the taste and aroma. It is recognized for its high-protein content, derived primarily from the beef used, and is generally considered a satisfying meal for those seeking substantial nutrition. While some descriptions note it as dairy-free, others do not explicitly confirm this, but given the absence of dairy ingredients in the standard preparation, it can be reasonably categorized as dairy-free.  \n\nIn terms of nutritional profile, Phở lõi bò is high in carbohydrates, primarily from the rice noodles, and contains moderate energy levels. It is also described as gluten-free, a feature that stems from the use of rice noodles instead of wheat-based alternatives. However, one description classifies the dish as high-carb and high-protein, while another specifies it as high-protein and gluten-free with moderate energy—this slight discrepancy is resolved by noting that the dish is indeed high in protein and carbohydrates, with energy levels being moderate due to the balance between protein and complex carbs. The inclusion of garlic and onion in the broth contributes to its robust flavor without introducing gluten, supporting its gluten-free classification.  \n\nThe dish is distinct from other phở variations due to its emphasis on the beef heel muscle, which imparts a rich, gelatinous texture and deep umami flavor to the broth. This ingredient is not only a source of protein but also contributes to the dish’s unique mouthfeel and depth. The combination of herbs and aromatic vegetables like lime further elevates the sensory experience, making Phở lõi bò a popular choice among those who appreciate both flavor and nutritional value.  \n\nDespite some conflicting details in the descriptions—such as one labeling it as high-carb and another as having moderate energy—the overall nutritional composition remains consistent: high in protein, high in carbohydrates, gluten-free, and dairy-free. These attributes make Phở lõi bò a suitable option for individuals following specific dietary preferences, including those avoiding gluten or dairy, while still enjoying a hearty, protein-rich meal.  \n\nIn summary, Phở lõi bò is a flavorful, nutritious Vietnamese dish made with beef heel muscle, rice noodles (bánh phở), garlic, onion, and lime, served in a fragrant broth. It is high in protein and carbohydrates, has moderate energy content, and is both gluten-free and dairy-free. Its balanced nutritional profile and rich taste make it a beloved choice in Vietnamese cuisine and among health-conscious diners seeking flavorful, satisfying meals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 563, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 789, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
