These compounds are present not only in the flesh but also in the peel of citrus fruits, indicating broad distribution within the fruit structure. Flavonoids play a key role in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, which are underlying factors in various chronic diseases. Their antioxidant properties contribute significantly to improved cardiovascular and metabolic health, helping to protect blood vessels and regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, flavonoids support immune function, enhancing the body’s ability to defend against pathogens. The presence of flavonoids in both the flesh and peel of citrus fruits suggests that consuming the entire fruit—rather than just the pulp—may maximize their health benefits. Overall, flavonoids are essential bioactive compounds that promote overall well-being through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, making them a valuable component of a balanced, plant-based diet. Their abundance in common dietary sources like citrus fruits underscores their importance in preventive health strategies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
