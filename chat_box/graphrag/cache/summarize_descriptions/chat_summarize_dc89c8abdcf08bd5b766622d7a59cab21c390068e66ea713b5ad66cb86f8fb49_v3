It plays a significant role in enhancing the flavor and aroma of the dish, contributing to its distinctive sensory profile. While the term \"Cần ta\" may occasionally be encountered in food-related contexts, its precise botanical identity or specific culinary application remains somewhat unclear in available sources. However, its consistent use in Miến riêu cua—where it is incorporated either in the broth (nước) or as a mixed component (trộn)—suggests that it functions as a valued aromatic herb in regional cooking practices. The herb is likely used in small quantities to provide a subtle, earthy, or slightly herbal note that complements the richness of the dish, which typically features crab and rice noodles. Though the exact origin or scientific classification of Cần ta is not well documented, its presence in traditional recipes indicates its cultural and culinary significance within Vietnamese home and regional kitchens. The term may also be used more broadly in food discussions, but its primary and most established role appears to be as a flavoring agent in specific dishes. There are no contradictory claims in the provided descriptions, and all information aligns around the herb’s function in enhancing taste and aroma. Therefore, Cần ta is best understood as a traditional Vietnamese herb integral to the flavor profile of Miến riêu cua, though further research may be needed to fully define its botanical characteristics or regional variations. Its use reflects the nuanced approach to seasoning in Vietnamese cuisine, where natural, locally sourced ingredients are carefully selected to achieve balance and authenticity. As such, Cần ta stands as a representative example of how regional herbs contribute to the depth and diversity of Vietnamese culinary traditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
