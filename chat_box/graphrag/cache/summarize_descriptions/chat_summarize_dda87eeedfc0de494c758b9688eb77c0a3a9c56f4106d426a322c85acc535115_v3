This connection highlights a culturally significant meal component that is commonly consumed during morning hours. While ĂN_SÁNG is broadly categorized as a meal type indicating breakfast, the descriptions do not universally link it to a single dish, with one noting the explicit association with *cháo trắng* and another suggesting that only some dishes may be consumed as part of a morning meal. This apparent discrepancy is resolved by recognizing that although ĂN_SÁNG as a category may include various morning foods, its most clearly defined and documented association is with *cháo trắng*, which serves as a representative dish within the breakfast context. Therefore, ĂN_SÁNG is best understood not merely as a generic morning meal category, but as a structured breakfast event centered around the preparation and consumption of *cháo trắng*. The dish is likely consumed in homes, local eateries, or community settings where traditional Vietnamese breakfast practices are preserved. Its inclusion in ĂN_SÁNG underscores the cultural and culinary significance of simple, nourishing meals that begin the day. Despite the lack of explicit mention of other dishes in the provided descriptions, the presence of *cháo trắng* as a key component suggests that ĂN_SÁNG may serve as a foundational meal in daily routines, particularly in rural or traditional Vietnamese households. The categorization of ĂN_SÁNG as a breakfast meal is consistent with broader culinary patterns in Vietnamese cuisine, where meals are often structured around specific times of day and traditional food forms. While some descriptions imply a broader range of possible dishes, the most concrete and specific link remains with *cháo trắng*, which provides a clear anchor point for understanding the nature of ĂN_SÁNG. Thus, ĂN_SÁNG is not only a meal category but a culturally grounded event that reflects daily habits and dietary traditions. It emphasizes the importance of accessible, warm, and sustaining foods in the morning, aligning with the values of simplicity, health, and continuity in Vietnamese home life. In summary, ĂN_SÁNG is a breakfast event with a distinct culinary identity, primarily defined by its association with *cháo trắng*, and serves as a meaningful representation of traditional Vietnamese morning meals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 488, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 677, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
