It serves as a concentrated source of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, as well as vitamin B12, all of which play critical roles in maintaining optimal health. The yolk also provides important minerals such as iron and selenium, contributing to functions like red blood cell formation and antioxidant defense. Additionally, egg yolk is a key ingredient in culinary applications such as mayonnaise, where its natural emulsifying properties—due to the presence of lecithin—enable the stable blending of oil and acid, resulting in a smooth and consistent texture. This makes it indispensable in both cooking and food preparation. Despite its high cholesterol content, which has been a subject of dietary discussion, the yolk remains a valuable source of choline, a nutrient essential for brain function, nerve development, and the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The combination of its nutritional profile and functional properties positions the egg yolk as a vital component in both nutrition and gastronomy. While some may view the yolk with caution due to its cholesterol, scientific evidence supports its role in providing essential nutrients that support overall well-being. In summary, EGG YOLK is not only a foundational element in many recipes but also a powerhouse of vital nutrients, offering a balanced array of vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds that contribute to health and culinary versatility.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
