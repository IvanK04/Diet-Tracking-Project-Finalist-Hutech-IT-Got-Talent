It plays a critical role in maintaining bone health, supporting energy production, and contributing to the structure of cell membranes. Found in a wide variety of foods, phosphorus is present in animal-based sources such as fish, dairy, meat, pork mince, beef, beef sausage, pork ears, and eggs, as well as in plant-based foods including legumes, vegetables, fruits like cantaloupe and plums, grains, nuts (such as peanuts and sesame seeds), and specific vegetables like turnip greens, shallots, red pepper flakes, mushrooms, ngò rí, tía tô, kinh giới, ngò tây, and ridge gourd. It is also found in less conventional sources such as sò điệp (scallops), tapioca flour, artichoke, glass noodles, red cabbage, dill, egg noodles, asparagus, and even in Vietnamese Balm and beef. Phosphorus is a key component in the mineral composition of dietary products and is involved in metabolic and structural processes across various tissues. While its presence in foods like parsnips, chili peppers, and fruits is noted, the primary sources consistently emphasize animal-based and plant-based dietary components. Although some descriptions mention specific regional or traditional foods, such as dồi huyết (blood sausage) and hạt vừng đen (black sesame seeds), these are consistent with broader dietary patterns involving bone and energy metabolism. All descriptions converge on phosphorus’s fundamental roles in bone health, energy storage, and cellular function, with no contradictory claims. The mineral is widely distributed across both animal and plant-based diets, making it accessible and essential for overall health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 1212, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
