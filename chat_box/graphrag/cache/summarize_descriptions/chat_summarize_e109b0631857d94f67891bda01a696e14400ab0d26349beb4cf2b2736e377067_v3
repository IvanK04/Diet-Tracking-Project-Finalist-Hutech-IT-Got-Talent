This category encompasses a variety of traditional Vietnamese dishes, with notable examples including cháo trắng (white porridge) and thịt lợn nạc xay hầm (ground lean pork stew). While cháo trắng is often associated with comfort and simplicity, its inclusion in the MÓN_CHÍNH category suggests it is presented as a substantial main dish in certain meal contexts, particularly when paired with side elements such as rau cai (fresh salad). The presence of thịt lợn nạc xay hầm—known for its rich, savory flavor and hearty texture—further reinforces the category’s focus on satisfying, protein-rich main dishes.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently identify MÓN_CHÍNH as a main course event or category, emphasizing its role in structured meal settings. Although some descriptions initially suggest cháo trắng may be more of a side or accompaniment, the repeated inclusion of it within the main course context, especially in combination with other main dishes, indicates that it is recognized as a primary component in certain traditional Vietnamese meals. This contextual integration suggests that the classification of cháo trắng as a main dish is not merely incidental but reflects its functional role in providing sustenance and balance within a meal.  \n\nAdditionally, the categorization of thịt lợn nạc xay hầm as a main dish aligns with broader culinary practices in Vietnamese cuisine, where stews and ground meat preparations are commonly served as central components of a meal. This dish, prepared by slow-cooking lean pork with aromatic spices and herbs, is valued for its depth of flavor and nutritional content, making it a fitting representative of the MÓN_CHÍNH category.  \n\nCollectively, the descriptions converge on a unified understanding: MÓN_CHÍNH is not a single dish but a meal category that defines the primary components of a meal, typically consumed during lunch or dinner. It includes both savory stews and comforting porridges, reflecting a balance between protein and texture. The category serves as a structural element in meal planning, helping to distinguish the main course from side dishes or beverages.  \n\nDespite minor variations in phrasing—such as the occasional mention of rau cai as part of the main course—the core theme remains consistent: MÓN_CHÍNH represents the central, substantial portion of a meal. The inclusion of rau cai may indicate a more holistic meal structure, where the main dish is complemented by fresh vegetables, but it does not contradict the primary classification of the category as a main course. Instead, it highlights the cultural practice of combining main dishes with fresh, light elements to enhance flavor and nutritional value.  \n\nIn summary, MÓN_CHÍNH is a well-defined meal category in Vietnamese culinary tradition, centered on hearty, satisfying dishes such as cháo trắng and thịt lợn nạc xay hầm. It is typically served during lunch or dinner and functions as the primary component of a meal, providing essential nutrients and flavor. While some dishes may have secondary or supporting roles, their inclusion in this category underscores their importance in the overall meal structure. MÓN_CHÍNH thus represents both a culinary and organizational framework within traditional Vietnamese dining.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 660, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 893, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
