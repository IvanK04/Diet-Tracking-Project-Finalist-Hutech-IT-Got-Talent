In addition to these micronutrients, green peas offer a high content of dietary fiber and protein, making them a valuable component in both vegan and balanced diets. This combination of macronutrients and micronutrients supports digestive health, muscle function, and metabolic balance. Their low-calorie profile further enhances their appeal in weight management and healthy lifestyle regimens. As a plant-based food, green peas provide a sustainable and nutrient-dense option that aligns with modern dietary trends emphasizing whole foods, sustainability, and wellness. Their natural composition supports a wide range of culinary applications, from soups and stews to side dishes and salads, making them a staple in diverse cuisines around the world.
