Present in these foods, quercetin contributes to a range of health benefits, primarily due to its potent antioxidant properties. In kale, quercetin supports anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects, helping to reduce oxidative stress and promote cellular health. Similarly, in onions, quercetin plays a key role in providing anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic benefits, which may help alleviate symptoms associated with allergic reactions and support immune function. These properties make quercetin a valuable component of a balanced, plant-rich diet. The compound is recognized for its ability to neutralize free radicals, thereby protecting cells from damage and potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases. While the specific concentrations and bioavailability may vary depending on the food source and preparation method, quercetin consistently demonstrates beneficial effects across different dietary contexts. Its presence in both leafy greens and root vegetables highlights its broad dietary availability and versatility.
