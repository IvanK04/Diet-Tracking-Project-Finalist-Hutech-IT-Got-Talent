These plant-based foods are low in calories and high in essential vitamins, particularly vitamin C and vitamin K, contributing to their status as a nutritious and healthy addition to a balanced diet. While some descriptions note the presence of vitamin A, the most consistent and supported nutritional profile emphasizes vitamins C and K, with no evidence of significant vitamin A content. Bean sprouts are also a moderate source of dietary fiber and plant-based protein, making them a valuable component in plant-based and vegetarian diets.\n\nIn culinary applications, bean sprouts are commonly consumed raw in salads, sandwiches, and wraps, where their crispness enhances texture and freshness. They are also frequently stir-fried quickly to preserve their crunch, appearing in popular dishes such as Thai pad Thai, Chinese chop suey, and other stir-fry recipes. Their versatility allows them to be incorporated into a wide range of meals, from light appetizers to main courses.\n\nNutritionally, bean sprouts are exceptionally high in water content, which contributes to their low caloric density and high satiety potential. This makes them ideal for individuals seeking low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods. Their high vitamin C content supports immune function and collagen production, while vitamin K plays a key role in blood clotting and bone health. Although they contain moderate amounts of protein, they are not a primary source of protein compared to legumes or animal products, but they do offer a small, plant-based contribution.\n\nDespite some descriptions mentioning mung beans or soybeans as sources, the data consistently identifies both as valid origins for bean sprouts, with no contradiction between the two. The primary distinction lies in the specific type of bean used, but both yield similar culinary and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is accurate to state that bean sprouts are grown from either mung beans or soybeans, depending on regional or recipe-specific preferences.\n\nIt is important to note that while bean sprouts are generally safe and healthy when consumed fresh and properly stored, they can become a breeding ground for bacteria if not handled or stored correctly, especially when left at room temperature for extended periods. This highlights the importance of proper food safety practices when preparing or consuming them.\n\nIn summary, BEAN SPROUTS are a nutritious, low-calorie, plant-based food valued for their crisp texture, mild flavor, and rich content of vitamins C and K. They are a staple in Asian cuisine, used in both raw and cooked preparations such as salads, stir-fries, and sandwiches. Their high water content and dietary fiber support digestive health, while their moderate protein and vitamin profile make them a beneficial addition to a variety of diets. Whether grown from mung beans or soybeans, BEAN SPROUTS remain a versatile and health-promoting ingredient in global culinary traditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 599, "prompt_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 953, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
