It plays a critical role in converting carbohydrates into energy and supports the health of the nervous system. Thiamin is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including whole grains, meat products such as chicken, pork, and pork mince, beef sausage, and fish. It is also found in plant-based foods like tofu, legumes, peanut butter, strawberries, and dill. Additionally, it is present in artichokes and pork ears, though the latter may be less commonly consumed. The vitamin is particularly important in maintaining metabolic efficiency and neurological function, making it a vital nutrient in a balanced diet. While thiamin is commonly associated with animal-based foods, its presence in both animal and plant sources underscores its broad dietary availability. Despite some descriptions mentioning specific food items like pork ears or strawberries, these are not central to its primary nutritional role and may represent minor or less significant sources. There are no contradictory claims regarding thiamin’s functions or essential roles; all descriptions consistently emphasize its involvement in energy and nerve metabolism. The information collectively confirms that thiamin is a fundamental B-vitamin with diverse dietary sources and critical physiological functions. Its presence in whole grains, meats, and certain vegetables ensures that it can be obtained through a variety of food groups, supporting overall metabolic and neurological health. Thus, thiamin remains a key nutrient in human nutrition, essential for both energy production and nervous system integrity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 722, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
