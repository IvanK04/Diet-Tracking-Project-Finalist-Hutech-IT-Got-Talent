Found in a wide variety of Vietnamese and global foods, including mang cuot, kale, mandarin oranges, papaya, dragon fruit, cai xoong, guava, lemons, bell peppers, mangoes, pomegranates, tomatoes, grapes, kumquats, chicken gizzard, chicken hearts, potatoes, and various vegetable dishes such as gan xào giá, Goi xoai, mực xào dứa, mực xào thập cẩm, su hao, Nộm rau muống, and Rau cải xoong xào tỏi, Vitamin C contributes significantly to immune function, skin health, and protection against oxidative stress. It is particularly abundant in fresh produce and plays a crucial role in preventing scurvy and promoting overall well-being. In specific dishes, Vitamin C content varies: for instance, 45mg is present in Goi xoai, 58mg in gan xào giá, 35mg in mực xào dứa, and 66mg in mực xào thập cẩm. It also supports digestive health through enzymatic activity in pandan and contributes to bone health and eye health in certain meals. While it is not a physical entity, Vitamin C is a fundamental nutrient present in both fruits and vegetables, with notable concentrations in mature red bell peppers and roasted peanuts. Its presence in traditional Vietnamese dishes underscores its cultural and nutritional significance, reinforcing its importance in daily diets for maintaining immune resilience, combating infections, and supporting cellular health. Despite minor variations in reported amounts across different dishes, all descriptions converge on Vitamin C’s central role in promoting health through antioxidant and immune-boosting properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 838, "total_tokens": 1210, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
