It is a high-quality source of protein, providing approximately 22 grams of protein per 85-gram (3-ounce) serving, with total fat content ranging from 6 to 10 grams depending on fat trimming, including saturated fat. While some sources indicate a protein content of 20% and fat content of 14%, these figures are likely based on broader compositional averages and may not reflect the typical serving size or trimming standards. The meat is particularly well-suited for quick cooking methods such as grilling or pan-frying, and it absorbs seasonings effectively, making it adaptable to a wide range of culinary traditions. Boneless Pork Chop is nutritionally beneficial, containing essential vitamins such as B12, B6, and E, as well as minerals like biotin and zinc, which support energy metabolism, immune function, and overall health. Its versatility and mild flavor make it a popular choice in both home and commercial kitchens. However, due to its lean nature, care must be taken during cooking to prevent it from drying out, especially when using high-heat methods. The product is widely recognized as a balanced and nutritious protein option, combining flavor, texture, and nutritional value. Despite minor discrepancies in protein and fat percentages across descriptions, the consistent emphasis on its origin, texture, cooking flexibility, and nutritional profile supports a unified understanding of Boneless Pork Chop as a lean, flavorful, and health-conscious meat product. This makes it a preferred choice for individuals seeking a protein-rich, easily prepared meal that complements diverse dietary preferences and cooking styles.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 356, "total_tokens": 703, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
