It is found in a wide variety of foods, including su hao, almonds, broccoli, peanut butter, enriched white bread, and millet. While dietary fiber contributes to overall digestive function, its presence and benefits vary across food sources. For instance, almonds and broccoli are notable for their high fiber content and are particularly effective in promoting digestive wellness and supporting a healthy gut microbiome. Peanut butter is recognized for its significant fiber content, which aids in digestion and provides sustained energy release. In contrast, enriched white bread, despite being a common source of fiber in processed foods, contains relatively low levels of fiber, limiting its effectiveness in supporting optimal digestive health. Millet, on the other hand, stands out not only for its fiber content but also for its ability to help regulate blood sugar levels, making it a beneficial choice for individuals managing low blood glucose. Although some sources suggest dietary fiber is present in enriched white bread, the low fiber content in this product diminishes its contribution to gut health compared to other fiber-rich foods. The consistent theme across all sources is that dietary fiber supports digestive function and promotes a healthy gut environment. However, the quality and quantity of fiber differ significantly among food sources, with whole, minimally processed plant foods like almonds, broccoli, and millet offering more substantial benefits. Therefore, while dietary fiber is essential for overall health, its effectiveness depends on the type and source of the fiber. Consumers are encouraged to prioritize whole, unprocessed plant foods to maximize the health benefits of dietary fiber. In summary, dietary fiber is a key nutrient found in diverse plant-based foods, contributing to improved digestion, sustained energy, and metabolic regulation—particularly in individuals with blood sugar concerns. Its benefits are most pronounced when derived from natural, high-fiber sources such as almonds, broccoli, peanut butter, and millet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
