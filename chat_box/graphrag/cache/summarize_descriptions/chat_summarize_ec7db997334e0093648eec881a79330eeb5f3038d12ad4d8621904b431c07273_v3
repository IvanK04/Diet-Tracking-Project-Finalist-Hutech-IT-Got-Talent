It serves as a key ingredient to enhance flavor and provide essential fat content, contributing to the overall taste and texture of the meals. The oil is noted for being free of allergens, making it a safe choice for individuals with common food sensitivities. While it is primarily valued for its role in flavor enhancement, some descriptions suggest that DẦU THỰC VẬT is low in fat and high in quality protein—however, this is contradictory to the general understanding of oils, which are primarily composed of fats and not significant sources of protein. Given that oils are lipid-based substances, the claim of high protein content is likely an error or misstatement. Therefore, the accurate characterization of DẦU THỰC VẬT is that it is a low-allergen vegetable oil used in frying and cooking, especially in fish and chicken dishes, where it contributes to flavor and provides necessary fat content. The protein content mentioned in the descriptions is not consistent with the biochemical nature of oils and is thus excluded from the final summary. DẦU THỰC VẬT is valued for its versatility and safety in culinary applications, offering a healthy fat source without introducing allergens. Its use in traditional Vietnamese dishes such as cá tuyết chién and cá rô phi chién highlights its cultural and practical importance in daily cooking. Despite minor inconsistencies in the provided descriptions, the core function and benefits of DẦU THỰC VẬT remain consistent: it is a safe, flavorful, and widely applicable cooking oil suitable for a variety of dishes. The final summary reflects only verified and scientifically accurate information, resolving contradictions by prioritizing the established properties of vegetable oils. Thus, DẦU THỰC VẬT is best described as a non-allergenic vegetable oil used in frying and seasoning, enhancing both the taste and nutritional profile of meals, particularly those involving fish and poultry.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 418, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 659, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
