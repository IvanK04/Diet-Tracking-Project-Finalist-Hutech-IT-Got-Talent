This attribute is consistently present across multiple menu items, including Phở with rare beef, Phở mixed with chicken, and Miến riêu cua. Potassium plays a vital role in maintaining proper physiological functions, particularly in supporting heart and muscle activity. It contributes to the regulation of blood pressure by helping to balance sodium levels in the body, which in turn promotes healthy blood vessel function and reduces the risk of hypertension. Additionally, high potassium content aids in maintaining fluid balance within the body, ensuring that cells receive adequate hydration and that electrolyte levels remain stable. The presence of HIGH_POTASSIUM in these dishes underscores their nutritional value, especially for individuals seeking foods that support cardiovascular and muscular health. This attribute is not limited to a single dish but is a common feature across the listed meals, suggesting a consistent dietary pattern in the menu that emphasizes potassium-rich ingredients. While the descriptions emphasize the health benefits of potassium, they do not indicate any adverse effects or contraindications related to high potassium intake, and thus no conflicting information is present. All provided descriptions align in their focus on the positive physiological roles of potassium, reinforcing the overall significance of HIGH_POTASSIUM as a beneficial nutritional marker. Therefore, HIGH_POTASSIUM serves as a reliable indicator of a dish’s contribution to heart and muscle function, blood pressure regulation, and fluid balance. Its presence in multiple dishes highlights a deliberate nutritional strategy aimed at promoting wellness through balanced electrolyte intake. This attribute is particularly relevant for individuals managing conditions such as hypertension or muscle fatigue, as it provides a natural, food-based approach to supporting these health goals. In summary, HIGH_POTASSIUM is a well-documented and beneficial nutritional feature found in Phở with rare beef, Phở mixed with chicken, and Miến riêu cua, offering consistent health advantages through its role in cardiovascular and muscular regulation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 402, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 615, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
