This process results in a soft, succulent, and evenly textured final product, making it ideal for dishes where tenderness and depth of flavor are desired. The method relies on consistent, gentle heat over extended periods—often several hours—allowing the connective tissues in meat to dissolve gradually, enhancing both texture and flavor development.\n\nWhile traditionally associated with meat, slow cooking can also be applied to other ingredients to extract and enhance their natural flavors. For instance, it is used to release the aromatic oils present in certain seafood, such as Trung Hai, through simmering in soups or stewing. This application highlights the method’s versatility in flavor infusion, where the slow, steady heat allows volatile compounds to emerge and meld with the base ingredients, creating aromatic and complex broths or stews.\n\nDespite the overlap in application, the primary purpose of slow cooking remains distinct in these contexts: for meat, it is a structural transformation that softens tough fibers; for seafood, it serves a flavor-activation function, emphasizing the release of essential oils and natural essences. These differing uses do not contradict one another but rather illustrate the adaptability of the technique across various food types and cultural cuisines.\n\nIt is important to note that while slow cooking is often linked to specific regional or traditional dishes—such as Vietnamese seafood stews involving Trung Hai—the core principle remains consistent: sustained, low-temperature heat applied over time. This ensures even cooking, minimizes the risk of overcooking, and allows for deep flavor development through natural enzymatic and chemical processes.\n\nIn summary, SLOW COOKING is a foundational method in both meat preparation and seafood flavor enhancement. Whether tenderizing back ribs or extracting aromatic oils from Trung Hai, the technique relies on patience, consistent heat, and time to achieve rich, satisfying results. Its dual applications underscore its value in creating flavorful, texturally appealing dishes across diverse culinary traditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 633, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
