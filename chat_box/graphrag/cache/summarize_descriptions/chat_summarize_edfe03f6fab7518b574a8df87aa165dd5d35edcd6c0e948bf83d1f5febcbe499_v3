It is widely used in Asian cuisine as a wrapper for various dishes, most notably spring rolls and other Southeast Asian wraps. The paper's unique texture and translucency allow it to hold its shape when properly prepared, and it becomes pliable when soaked in water, making it ideal for rolling and forming dishes. This characteristic is essential in the preparation of traditional rolled foods, where the rice paper provides a delicate, crisp outer layer that complements the filling. While primarily associated with culinary applications, rice paper is valued not only for its functional properties but also for its cultural significance in Asian cooking traditions. Its production process typically involves mixing rice flour with water, then pressing and drying the mixture into sheets. The resulting product is lightweight, flexible, and capable of maintaining structural integrity during cooking and serving. Despite its simple composition, rice paper plays a vital role in the preparation of numerous regional dishes across Southeast Asia, including Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese cuisines. Its use extends beyond spring rolls, appearing in a variety of other dishes such as dumplings, rolls, and fresh vegetable wraps. The material's natural origin and biodegradability also make it an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic wrappers. Overall, rice paper remains a fundamental component in both home kitchens and professional culinary settings, where its versatility and authenticity contribute to the flavor and presentation of traditional Asian meals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 537, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
