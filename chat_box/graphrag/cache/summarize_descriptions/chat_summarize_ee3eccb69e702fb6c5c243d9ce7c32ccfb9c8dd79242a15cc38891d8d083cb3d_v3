It serves as a critical cofactor in various enzymatic reactions, particularly those involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, thereby supporting the body’s ability to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. In addition to its role in energy metabolism, riboflavin contributes to antioxidant defense mechanisms by helping to maintain the integrity of cellular components such as lipids and DNA, reducing oxidative stress and protecting against cellular damage. This vitamin is naturally present in a variety of dietary sources, including coconut and mango, making it accessible through a balanced diet. Its presence in these fruits and nuts underscores its importance in both everyday nutrition and overall metabolic health. Riboflavin is also involved in the synthesis of other vital coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are indispensable in redox reactions throughout the body. These coenzymes play a key role in the breakdown of nutrients and the regulation of metabolic pathways. Deficiency in riboflavin can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, sensitivity to light, skin disorders, and impaired growth, highlighting its significance in maintaining physiological balance. Despite its widespread presence in natural foods, adequate intake remains dependent on dietary consumption, as the body does not store riboflavin in significant amounts. Therefore, consistent inclusion of riboflavin-rich foods like coconut and mango is recommended to support long-term health. Overall, riboflavin (B2) stands as a foundational nutrient in human metabolism, contributing not only to energy generation but also to the body’s resilience against oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction. Its dual role in energy metabolism and antioxidant activity positions it as a vital component of a healthy diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
