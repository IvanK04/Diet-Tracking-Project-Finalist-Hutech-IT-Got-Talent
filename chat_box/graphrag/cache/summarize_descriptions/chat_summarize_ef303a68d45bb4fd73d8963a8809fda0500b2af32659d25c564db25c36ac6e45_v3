They are also a good source of high-quality protein, antioxidants, and essential minerals including iron, zinc, and magnesium. Due to their nutrient density, walnuts are often recommended as part of a balanced diet aimed at promoting overall wellness. However, walnuts are high in calories and contain allergens, making them a potential trigger for individuals with tree nut allergies. As a tree nut, they are classified as allergenic and should be consumed with caution by those with known sensitivities. Despite their nutritional benefits, individuals with nut allergies must avoid walnuts to prevent adverse reactions. Overall, walnuts offer significant health advantages when consumed in moderation and as part of a well-rounded diet, but their allergenic nature requires awareness and careful consideration, especially in households or populations with a history of nut allergies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
