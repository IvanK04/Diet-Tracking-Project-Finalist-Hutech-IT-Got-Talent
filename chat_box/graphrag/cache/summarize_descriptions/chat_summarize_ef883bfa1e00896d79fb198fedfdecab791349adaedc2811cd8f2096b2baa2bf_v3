This dish is well-known for its nutritional benefits, offering 7.5 grams of high-quality protein, 289 micrograms of Vitamin A, and significant amounts of Vitamin C, which support vision health and strengthen the immune system. Its low carbohydrate content—only 5.4 grams—makes it an excellent choice for individuals following low-carb diets, as it helps maintain stable blood sugar levels and supports natural detoxification of the body. The dish is valued not only for its taste but also for its health-promoting properties, making it a popular and wholesome option in Vietnamese households. The combination of bitter melon’s natural compounds and eggs’ essential nutrients contributes to a well-rounded meal that is both satisfying and beneficial for overall wellness. While the descriptions emphasize the dish’s traditional roots and nutritional profile, there is no contradiction between them—both highlight the same key elements: the use of bitter melon and eggs, the protein and vitamin content, and the low-carb nature of the dish. The slight variation in flavor description—referring to the eggs as \"rich and aromatic\" versus \"rich and savory\"—is consistent with culinary context, as both terms describe the egg’s contribution to the dish’s depth and balance. Ultimately, Mướp đắng xào trứng stands out as a nutritious, culturally significant, and health-conscious meal that aligns with both traditional Vietnamese cuisine and modern dietary needs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 323, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 646, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
