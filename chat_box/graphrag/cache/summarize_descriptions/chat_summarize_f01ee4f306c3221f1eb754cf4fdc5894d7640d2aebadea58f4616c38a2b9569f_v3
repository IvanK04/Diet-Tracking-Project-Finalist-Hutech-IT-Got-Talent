It is found in a variety of foods, including sugarcane juice, chè thái, egg yolk, paprika, ngò rí, tía tô, tamarind sauce, pear, and mangosteen. In certain dishes, such as Cháo lươn cay, Vitamin A is derived from beta-carotene and contributes to vision and immune support. Notably, Vitamin A content varies across dishes: one serving of Nộm bò khô contains 701.7 µg, while another dish contains a higher amount of 2884 µg, supporting overall eye health and immune function. Although the exact sources and concentrations differ, all descriptions consistently highlight Vitamin A’s critical role in maintaining healthy vision, a robust immune system, and skin integrity. The presence of Vitamin A in both plant-based sources like paprika, tamarind, and leafy herbs, as well as in animal-based sources such as egg yolk, underscores its broad dietary availability. While some descriptions mention specific food items with high concentrations, such as the 2884 µg in one dish, the overall consensus emphasizes its fundamental importance across multiple food groups. Contradictions in reported amounts are resolved by acknowledging that Vitamin A content varies by food preparation, source, and measurement, with the higher value likely reflecting a specific preparation or ingredient concentration. Despite these variations, the core functions—vision, immune function, and skin health—remain consistent throughout all references. Thus, Vitamin A stands as a vital micronutrient, widely distributed in both natural foods and traditional dishes, playing a central role in human health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 781, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
