It is rich in monounsaturated fats, which are beneficial for cardiovascular health, and contains a significant amount of vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant that supports overall heart function and cellular protection. The combination of these nutritional components contributes to its reputation as a healthy cooking oil when used appropriately. While the oil undergoes refinement to remove impurities and enhance stability, this process preserves its key beneficial fats and nutrients. Peanut oil is widely used in both culinary and industrial applications due to its neutral flavor and performance under high temperatures. Its high smoke point—typically ranging between 450°F and 475°F (232°C to 246°C)—ensures minimal formation of harmful compounds during cooking, further supporting its use in healthy meal preparation. Despite being derived from a plant source, peanut oil is not a nut oil in the traditional sense, as it is processed from the seed of the peanut plant, which is botanically classified as a legume. This distinction is important for individuals with nut allergies, as peanut oil may still be safe for consumption in such cases, though cross-contamination risks should be considered. Overall, peanut oil stands out as a versatile and nutritionally supportive option in modern cooking, offering a balance of stability, flavor neutrality, and health-promoting fats. The consistent emphasis across the provided descriptions on its monounsaturated fat content, vitamin E levels, and high smoke point confirms its role as a functional and health-oriented cooking oil. There are no contradictory elements in the descriptions provided; all information aligns in supporting the nutritional and culinary advantages of peanut oil. Therefore, the final summary reflects a unified and coherent understanding of the product.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
