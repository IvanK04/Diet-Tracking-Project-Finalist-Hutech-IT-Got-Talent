It plays a vital role in maintaining overall health by supporting cellular functions and immune responses. Zinc is widely distributed across both animal and plant-based foods, demonstrating its broad dietary availability. Key dietary sources include animal products such as whole chicken, beef, pork belly, chicken breast, pork ears, and beef sausage; seafood and shellfish like scallops, sea bass, sò điệp (clams), and fish; and plant-based foods including whole grains, egg noodles, glass noodles, tapioca flour, asparagus, artichoke, red cabbage, red beets, paprika, parsnips, chili peppers, shallots, peas, onions, ngò tây (cilantro), kinh giới (a Vietnamese herb), and ridge gourd. Additionally, zinc is found in legumes, peanut butter, and tofu. Its presence in diverse food groups—ranging from meats and seafood to vegetables and grains—highlights its accessibility and importance in various diets. While some descriptions note its role in enzyme activity and metabolic function, others emphasize wound healing and DNA synthesis, which are all interconnected aspects of zinc’s physiological functions. Although certain sources list specific foods like Vietnamese Balm or Vietnamese herbs (e.g., kinh giới, ngò tây), these are likely regional or traditional food items and do not contradict the broader nutritional profile. All descriptions converge on zinc’s critical role in immune function and tissue repair, with consistent mentions of its presence in both animal and plant-based sources. The mineral is recognized in nutritional metadata with health tags indicating its presence, reinforcing its significance in dietary planning. In summary, zinc is a versatile and essential trace mineral found in a wide array of foods, supporting immune health, wound healing, enzyme activity, and cellular processes across diverse dietary patterns.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 1106, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
