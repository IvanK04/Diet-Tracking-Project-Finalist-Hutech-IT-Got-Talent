DẦU THỰC VẬT plays a key role in the preparation of this dish, serving as both a cooking medium and a seasoning agent. It is used to sauté the pork stomach and vegetables, helping to achieve a desirable texture by promoting even browning and preventing the ingredients from becoming overly dry. Additionally, DẦU THỰC VẬT enhances the overall flavor profile of LÒNG XÀO DƯA, contributing a mild, nutty richness that complements the tangy and slightly sour notes of the pickled vegetables. The use of plant-based oil aligns with traditional Vietnamese culinary practices that emphasize natural, wholesome ingredients and avoid animal fats. While some variations may incorporate additional seasonings such as garlic, chili, or fish sauce, the foundational role of DẦU THỰC VẬT remains consistent across preparations. This oil not only aids in cooking but also helps preserve the integrity of the ingredients, ensuring that the dish maintains its characteristic balance of textures—crispy on the surface, tender within—and flavors. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the functional and sensory contributions of DẦU THỰC VẬT to LÒNG XÀO DƯA. Together, these elements form a harmonious and authentic representation of the dish, rooted in traditional Vietnamese home cooking methods. The combination of the pork stomach, pickled vegetables, and the use of vegetable oil results in a flavorful, satisfying meal that is both culturally significant and widely enjoyed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
