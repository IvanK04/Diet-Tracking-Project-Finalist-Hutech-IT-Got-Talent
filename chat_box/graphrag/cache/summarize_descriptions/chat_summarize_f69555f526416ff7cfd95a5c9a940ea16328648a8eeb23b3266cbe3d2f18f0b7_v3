Made primarily from tapioca or rice flour, trân châu provides a soft, elastic consistency that enhances the overall mouthfeel of the desserts it is incorporated into. It is typically served as a sweet topping, adding both texture and flavor to the dishes. The ingredient is widely recognized in Vietnamese culinary culture and is a staple in both classic and modern sweet preparations. While some descriptions refer to it as a type of jelly bean, this characterization is less accurate in the context of traditional Vietnamese cuisine, where trân châu is specifically a chewy ball crafted from starch-based ingredients rather than a candy-like jelly bean. Therefore, the most accurate and consistent description of trân châu is that it is a chewy, starch-based ball made from tapioca or rice flour, used as a key component in various Vietnamese desserts. Its versatility allows it to be integrated into both cold and warm beverages and desserts, making it a beloved element in the region’s confectionery traditions. The ingredient is not only valued for its texture but also for its ability to complement rich, aromatic flavors such as coconut, black sesame, and mixed fruit. Despite minor variations in the specific desserts mentioned across descriptions, all sources converge on the core identity of trân châu as a chewy, rice or tapioca-based component central to Vietnamese sweet cuisine. This unified understanding reflects its enduring role in both home cooking and commercial dessert offerings throughout Vietnam.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
