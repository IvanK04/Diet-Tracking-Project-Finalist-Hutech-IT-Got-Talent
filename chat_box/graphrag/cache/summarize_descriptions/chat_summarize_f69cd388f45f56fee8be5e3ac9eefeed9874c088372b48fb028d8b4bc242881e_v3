This category emphasizes the role of such dishes in restoring sensory balance, often serving as a transitional element between the richness of a meal and the next course or the end of dining. Examples include *kem sữa chua trân châu* and *háo cảo hấp*, both of which are characterized by their light, refreshing textures and flavors that contrast with heavier, more savory dishes. The primary function of TRÁNG_MIỆNG is not to provide substantial nutrition or satiety, but rather to cleanse the taste buds, offering a moment of sensory reset. This makes it particularly common in traditional Vietnamese dining culture, where meals are structured to include a variety of textures and flavors to enhance overall dining experience. The category is often used in menu categorization to guide diners toward lighter, less intense flavors after a meal rich in protein, fat, or spice. While some may interpret TRÁNG_MIỆNG as a dessert category, it is more accurately described as a functional palate-cleansing category that may include both sweet and savory elements. For instance, *háo cảo hấp*, though savory, serves a similar purpose by offering a mild, delicate flavor that helps transition the palate. Similarly, *kem sữa chua trân châu*, with its creamy and slightly tangy profile, provides a refreshing contrast to heavier dishes. Therefore, TRÁNG_MIỆNG is not strictly limited to desserts but encompasses a broader range of dishes designed to refresh and balance the palate. The term reflects a cultural understanding of meal structure, where balance and variety are essential. In practice, TRÁNG_MIỆNG items are typically served after the main course, often as part of a structured meal experience. This category does not imply a specific level of sweetness or complexity, but rather a functional role in the dining sequence. It is important to note that while some descriptions may suggest a dessert-specific nature, the evidence supports a broader, functional definition that includes both sweet and savory options. Thus, TRÁNG_MIỆNG is best understood as a palate-cleansing category that enhances the overall dining experience by providing a sensory break. Its inclusion in menus signals to diners that the dish serves a restorative purpose, not a primary source of sustenance. In summary, TRÁNG_MIỆNG represents a thoughtful culinary practice rooted in balance, flavor contrast, and sensory harmony, ensuring that the dining experience remains enjoyable and well-rounded.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 518, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 718, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
