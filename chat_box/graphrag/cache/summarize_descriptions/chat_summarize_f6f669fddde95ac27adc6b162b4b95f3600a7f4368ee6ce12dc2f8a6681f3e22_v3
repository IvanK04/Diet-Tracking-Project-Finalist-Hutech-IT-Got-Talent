It plays a key role in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for memory, muscle control, and cognitive function. As a precursor to phospholipids, choline contributes to the formation and stability of cell membranes, supporting overall cellular function. Found in a variety of dietary sources, choline is present in egg yolk, where it supports brain function, neurotransmitter production, and cell membrane structure. It is also abundant in chicken liver, which enhances liver function and brain health, and in bean sprouts, black beans, and almonds, where it supports both brain and liver function. Sunflower seeds and salmon are additional rich sources, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining optimal neurological and hepatic health. While some descriptions mention choline in the context of oil-based foods such as sesame oil and coconut oil, these references appear to be linguistic inaccuracies—choline is not a mineral or a typical component of oils in the same way as fats; rather, it is a nutrient that can be present in small amounts in oils derived from choline-rich foods. The Vietnamese statement suggesting choline is found in sesame and coconut oil is likely a misattribution or translation error, as choline is not a primary component of these oils. Therefore, the accurate sources of choline are best understood as animal and plant-based foods such as egg yolk, chicken liver, beans, bean sprouts, almonds, sunflower seeds, and salmon. Choline's multifaceted role in brain function, liver health, and cellular structure underscores its significance in human nutrition. Despite minor discrepancies in the source descriptions, all evidence converges on choline’s critical functions in neurological and metabolic processes. Thus, choline stands as a key nutrient supporting cognitive performance, cellular integrity, and liver function across diverse dietary sources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 388, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 774, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
