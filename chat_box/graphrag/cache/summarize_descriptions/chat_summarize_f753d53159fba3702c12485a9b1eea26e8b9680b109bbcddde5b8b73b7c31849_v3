They are distinguished by their mild, sweet flavor, which is significantly less pungent than that of garlic, making them ideal for a wide range of culinary applications—particularly in raw preparations such as vinaigrettes and in slow-cooked dishes where their natural sugars caramelize to enhance flavor. This subtle depth of taste allows shallots to add complexity to sauces, stir-fries, and other dishes without overpowering other ingredients, a trait that makes them especially popular in French cuisine.\n\nNutritionally, shallots are a well-rounded source of essential vitamins and minerals. A single shallot weighs approximately 49 grams and contains 72 calories, 2.5 grams of protein, 16.8 grams of carbohydrates, and a negligible 0.1 gram of fat. They are rich in a variety of vitamins, including vitamins A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex vitamins such as folate. Additionally, they provide important minerals like iron and sodium. Their high antioxidant content, particularly quercetin, contributes to their health benefits, supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress in the body.\n\nWhile some descriptions note that shallots are used as a seasoning with a focus on their vitamin profile, others emphasize their role in enhancing flavor through caramelization and their use in both raw and cooked preparations. These descriptions are consistent in highlighting shallots' versatility and their role in both everyday cooking and gourmet applications. The slight variation in vitamin listing—such as the inclusion of vitamin D and E—can be reconciled by recognizing that while allium vegetables contain a broad spectrum of vitamins, the specific levels may vary by variety and preparation. Nonetheless, the presence of vitamins C, E, K, folate, and B-complex vitamins is well-supported across the data.\n\nShallots are not only valued for their flavor but also for their health-promoting properties. Their antioxidant content, especially quercetin, has been linked to anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects, further enhancing their appeal in both culinary and nutritional contexts. This makes them a valuable ingredient in balanced diets and health-conscious cooking.\n\nIn summary, shallots are a versatile, nutrient-dense allium vegetable that combines a delicate sweetness with a robust flavor profile. They are widely used in French and international cuisines to add subtle depth to sauces, stir-fries, and dressings. With a balanced nutritional composition and high levels of antioxidants, shallots offer both culinary and health benefits, making them a staple in modern kitchens. Their mild pungency and ability to caramelize make them especially effective in dishes where a nuanced, background flavor is desired. Whether used raw or cooked, shallots enhance the complexity of meals while contributing essential vitamins and minerals to the diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 589, "prompt_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 964, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
