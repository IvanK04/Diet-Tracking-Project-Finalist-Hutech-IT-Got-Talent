Diets high in potassium, such as those containing 'Mực trứng chiên' (deep-fried squid eggs), which provide 873.6mg of potassium and 15mg of vitamin C, support cardiovascular function and enhance immune strength. Similarly, potassium-rich foods contribute to maintaining healthy blood pressure and reducing strain on the heart. Foods rich in fiber and essential nutrients—such as whole wheat bread—help lower cholesterol levels and promote cardiovascular function. The consumption of unsalted sunflower seeds, high in healthy unsaturated fats, further supports heart health by improving lipid profiles. Oatmeal, due to its beta-glucan content, plays a key role in reducing LDL cholesterol and supporting long-term cardiovascular wellness. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish like whole sea bass and Salmon Atlantis, are particularly effective in reducing bad cholesterol, decreasing inflammation, and improving blood circulation. These benefits are amplified by the inclusion of antioxidant-rich foods such as pork ears and Vietnamese coriander, which protect blood vessels and reduce oxidative stress. Additionally, plant-based foods like almonds and broccoli contribute to heart health through their high levels of monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. Tomatoes, rich in lycopene, are also linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes. Collectively, these dietary components—spanning potassium, fiber, omega-3s, antioxidants, and healthy fats—create a synergistic effect that strengthens the heart and supports overall circulatory function. While some descriptions mention specific dishes or ingredients, the overarching theme is consistent: a balanced diet emphasizing whole, minimally processed foods rich in essential nutrients significantly enhances heart health. Contradictions in the descriptions—such as varying references to specific dishes—are resolved by recognizing that each food item serves as a vehicle for delivering key nutrients that collectively support cardiovascular well-being. Thus, HEART HEALTH is not isolated to one food but is a systemic benefit derived from a diverse, nutrient-dense dietary pattern.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 419, "prompt_tokens": 454, "total_tokens": 873, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
