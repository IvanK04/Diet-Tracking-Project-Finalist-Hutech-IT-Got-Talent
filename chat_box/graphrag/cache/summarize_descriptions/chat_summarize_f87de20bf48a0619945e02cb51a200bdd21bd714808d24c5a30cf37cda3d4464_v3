It is widely distributed across a variety of dietary sources, including animal-based foods such as fish, seafood (e.g., scallops, sea bass, and cá rô), eggs, chicken breast, beef sausage, and dairy products. Plant-based sources also contain selenium, such as Brazil nuts, grains, nuts (including peanuts), grains (e.g., egg noodles, glass noodles, tapioca flour), legumes (e.g., soybeans, tofu), and various vegetables like parsnips, chili peppers, shallots, turnip greens, ridge gourd, dill, ngò rí, ngò tây, red cabbage, and bitter melon. Additionally, selenium is present in fruits such as strawberries and pears, as well as in less common items like sò điệp, artichoke, vinegar, and sầu riêng. The mineral functions as a key component of antioxidant enzymes, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage and supporting overall cellular health. Selenium is particularly important for thyroid hormone metabolism and immune system regulation, and it is frequently noted in nutritional data and health tags associated with foods labeled \"giàu_selenium.\" While selenium is present in small amounts in many plant-based foods, its bioavailability can vary depending on the food source and soil content. Despite some inconsistencies in specific food associations, all descriptions converge on selenium’s primary roles: as an antioxidant, a supporter of thyroid and immune function, and a trace mineral found across diverse dietary sources. This consistent pattern underscores its significance in human nutrition and wellness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 809, "total_tokens": 1142, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
