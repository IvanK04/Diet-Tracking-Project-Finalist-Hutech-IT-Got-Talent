It is known for its vibrant yellow-orange to translucent flesh, which has a sweet, floral aroma and a light, delicate flavor with subtle sweetness and a texture similar to grapes. The fruit typically has a long, curved shape and a thin, crisp skin that peels easily to reveal a soft, smooth interior, though it may have a slightly fibrous consistency. When ripe, mango offers quick energy due to its easily digestible carbohydrates and is particularly rich in essential nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and antioxidants. These nutrients support immune function, muscle and nervous system health, and overall well-being. Green mangoes, in contrast, contain more resistant starch, which provides a slower release of energy, making them suitable for different dietary needs. Mango is widely consumed fresh as a snack or dessert, and its versatility extends to culinary applications such as smoothies, salsas, grilled dishes, frozen desserts, and savory preparations. The fruit contains natural digestive enzymes like amylase, which aid in breaking down starches, enhancing its role in digestion. While it is commonly enjoyed for its sweet, juicy flesh, it also has a mild, less sour flavor compared to other tropical fruits like rambutan. The black, shiny seeds inside are typically inedible and removed before consumption. Overall, mango stands out as a nutrient-dense, flavorful fruit that combines refreshing taste with significant health benefits, making it a staple in both global cuisines and health-conscious diets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 520, "total_tokens": 847, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
