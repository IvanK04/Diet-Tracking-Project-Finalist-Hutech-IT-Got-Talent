It is high in vitamin C and beta-carotene, and contains notable amounts of magnesium and iron. The drink provides 177.6 calories per serving, with 4.4 grams of protein and 40 grams of carbohydrates, and contains no fat. A key component of Nước ép dứa is the enzyme bromelain, which is present in both passion fruit and pineapple, potentially contributing to its digestive properties. While one description refers to pineapple as the primary ingredient, the more detailed nutritional profile aligns with passion fruit as the base, indicating that the most accurate formulation is derived from grated passion fruit. The drink is a good source of essential nutrients, including small amounts of protein, zinc, iron, magnesium, and beta-carotene, though the exact contribution of zinc is not fully specified. It is important to note that bromelain, an enzyme allergen, may trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals and should be considered in dietary planning. Despite the initial mention of pineapple, the nutritional data and ingredient details support passion fruit as the primary source. Therefore, the comprehensive description of Nước ép dứa emphasizes its origin in grated passion fruit, its rich vitamin and mineral content, and its enzymatic composition. The drink is energizing due to its high carbohydrate content, making it suitable for those seeking a quick energy boost. However, due to the presence of bromelain, individuals with known enzyme sensitivities or allergies should consume it with caution. The beverage is not a significant source of fat or zinc, though it does provide moderate protein. Overall, Nước ép dứa is a nutritious, naturally derived drink that combines essential vitamins and minerals, offering both health benefits and potential allergenic considerations. Its preparation involves minimal processing, preserving the natural enzymes and nutrients found in passion fruit. This makes it a popular choice in tropical regions where fresh fruit is readily available. While some confusion exists between pineapple and passion fruit as ingredients, the nutritional data and ingredient specificity point to passion fruit as the correct base. Thus, Nước ép dứa is best understood as a passion fruit-based drink rich in vitamin C, beta-carotene, magnesium, and iron, with a moderate carbohydrate content and a notable enzyme component.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 482, "prompt_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 744, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
