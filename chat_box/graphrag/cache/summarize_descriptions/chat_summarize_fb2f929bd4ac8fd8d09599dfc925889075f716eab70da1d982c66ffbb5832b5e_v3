Per 85 grams, it contains 17.2 grams of protein and 18 grams of fat, making it a nutrient-dense option. This cut is a valuable source of essential vitamins, including niacin, vitamin B12, and iron, as well as key minerals that support overall health. Due to its high connective tissue content, pork shoulder, raw is not typically tender when uncooked; however, when subjected to slow, low-temperature cooking methods, the connective tissues break down into gelatin, resulting in a soft, melt-in-the-mouth texture. This makes it particularly well-suited for long-cooking methods such as stews, braises, and pulled meat dishes. While raw, the meat retains its structural integrity and is often preferred by home cooks and chefs for its ability to transform into a flavorful, tender product when properly prepared. Its nutritional profile supports energy production and red blood cell formation, thanks to its high levels of B vitamins and iron. Despite its fat content, pork shoulder remains a popular choice in traditional and modern cuisines for its depth of flavor and versatility. The combination of protein, fat, and essential nutrients positions pork shoulder, raw as both a culinary and nutritional staple. Its transformation during cooking enhances its palatability and makes it a go-to ingredient in hearty, satisfying meals. Overall, pork shoulder, raw is a balanced, flavorful cut that offers both nutritional value and culinary potential when prepared correctly.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 323, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 572, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
