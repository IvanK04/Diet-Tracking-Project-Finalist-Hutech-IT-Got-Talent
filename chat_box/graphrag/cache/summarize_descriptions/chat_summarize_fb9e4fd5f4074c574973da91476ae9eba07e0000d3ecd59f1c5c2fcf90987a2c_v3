It supports the synthesis of connective tissue and acts as a cofactor for various enzymes involved in metabolic processes. Found in a wide range of dietary sources, manganese is present in black beans and almonds, bean sprouts, bitter melon, vinegar, pork sausages, catfish fillet, chicken livers, pears, mangosteen, sunflower seeds, salmon, and sticky rice. These diverse food sources highlight its broad dietary availability. Its functions extend beyond metabolism to include antioxidant enzyme activity, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage. While manganese is vital for metabolic and skeletal health, it is important to note that it is required in trace amounts—excess intake can be harmful. The mineral's presence in both plant-based and animal-based foods underscores its accessibility across different diets. Despite some variations in the specific food sources mentioned, all descriptions converge on manganese’s central roles in bone development, metabolic regulation, and antioxidant protection. Contradictions in the list—such as the mention of mangosteen and pears being primary sources—are resolved by recognizing that these are simply examples of its dietary distribution, not exclusive or unique sources. Overall, manganese functions as a key trace mineral that contributes to metabolic efficiency, structural integrity of bones and connective tissues, and cellular defense mechanisms. Its presence in both common and less conventional foods ensures that it can be obtained through a varied diet. Therefore, manganese is a fundamental nutrient that supports multiple physiological systems, particularly those related to metabolism and bone health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 331, "prompt_tokens": 421, "total_tokens": 752, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
