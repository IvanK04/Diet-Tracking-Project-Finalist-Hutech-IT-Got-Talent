It is typically used in the form of fried eggs or as an ingredient in pate and sauces, contributing to the flavor and texture of these dishes. The presence of TRỨNG in these foods poses a significant risk for individuals with egg allergies, as even small amounts can trigger allergic reactions. This allergenic nature is consistent across multiple dishes, indicating that TRỨNG is a widespread ingredient in both traditional and popular meals. While some dishes may use eggs in visible forms such as fried eggs, others incorporate them more subtly—such as in sauces or prepared fillings—making it difficult for individuals with allergies to identify and avoid the ingredient. The fact that TRỨNG appears in both breakfast-style dishes like Xôi trắng and more substantial meals like Mỳ vằn thắn and Bánh mì chảo underscores its versatility and prevalence in the culinary repertoire. Despite variations in preparation, the consistent use of eggs across these dishes highlights the need for clear labeling and awareness among consumers with egg sensitivities. Therefore, TRỨNG serves not only as a key flavoring agent but also as a critical consideration in food safety and allergen management. Its role in both simple and complex dishes emphasizes the importance of vigilance in food preparation and consumption, particularly for those with known allergies. Overall, TRỨNG is a fundamental yet potentially hazardous component in Vietnamese cuisine, requiring careful attention in both household cooking and restaurant service.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 564, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
