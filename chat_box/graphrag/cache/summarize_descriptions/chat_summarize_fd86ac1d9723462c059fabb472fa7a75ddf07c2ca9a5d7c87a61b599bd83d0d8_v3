While commonly associated with wheat, noodles in Vietnamese cuisine are often made from rice, offering a soft, white, and slightly firm texture. These rice noodles are typically pre-portioned and added directly to boiling broth, where they cook quickly and absorb the broth’s rich flavors, enhancing the overall taste of the dish. This characteristic makes them a preferred ingredient in hot pot meals, where they serve as the primary source of carbohydrates, providing 50–80 grams of carbohydrates per serving. Their easy texture and fast cooking time contribute to their popularity across various hot pot varieties. Although the descriptions emphasize rice-based noodles, it is important to note that wheat-based noodles also play a significant role in Vietnamese cuisine, particularly in dishes like pho, where they provide a distinct texture and flavor profile. The versatility of noodles—available in fresh, dried, or boiled forms—allows them to be adapted to a wide range of culinary preparations, from soups to stir-fries. Their integration into both traditional and contemporary meals underscores their cultural and nutritional importance. Noodles are not only a dietary staple but also a key element in the flavor and structure of Vietnamese food, offering both convenience and culinary depth. The combination of their quick cooking time, ability to absorb flavors, and high carbohydrate content makes them a central component in many daily meals. Despite some descriptions focusing exclusively on rice-based varieties, the broader context confirms that noodles in Vietnamese cuisine encompass both rice and wheat varieties, reflecting regional diversity and culinary tradition. Thus, Noodles remain a fundamental and adaptable food item in Vietnamese culinary practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 409, "total_tokens": 758, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
