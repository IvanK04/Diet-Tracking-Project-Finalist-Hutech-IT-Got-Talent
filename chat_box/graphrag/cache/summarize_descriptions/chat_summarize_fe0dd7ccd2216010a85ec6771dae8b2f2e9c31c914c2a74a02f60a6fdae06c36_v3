Designed for convenience, it serves as a versatile seasoning product commonly used in cooking to enhance the taste of soups and other dishes. Each 20-gram serving of SOUP POWDER contains 17.5 grams of carbohydrates and 70 calories, making it a relatively low-calorie option for flavor enhancement. It is part of a broader range of culinary seasonings, offering users a ready-to-use alternative to traditional soup-making methods.\n\nA key characteristic of SOUP POWDER is its high sodium content, which significantly contributes to its intense flavor profile. This elevated sodium level is effective in seasoning and deepening the taste of soups, but it also raises concerns for cardiovascular health. Due to the potential risks associated with excessive sodium intake, experts recommend consuming SOUP POWDER in moderation—particularly for individuals with hypertension, heart conditions, or those at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.\n\nDespite its convenience and flavor-enhancing properties, SOUP POWDER should be used thoughtfully in meals. Its formulation prioritizes taste and ease of preparation over nutritional balance, making it more suitable as a flavor booster than a primary ingredient in balanced diets. The product is especially popular in households and commercial kitchens where time efficiency and consistent flavor are essential.\n\nThe information provided consistently supports the idea that SOUP POWDER functions as a dehydrated seasoning blend, combining vegetables, seasonings, and salt to deliver a ready-to-use broth base. There are no contradictory elements in the descriptions; all details align in describing its composition, usage, nutritional profile, and health considerations. The repeated mention of its 20-gram weight, 17.5 grams of carbohydrates, and 70-calorie count reinforces its standardized packaging and nutritional labeling. Additionally, the emphasis on high sodium levels and the need for moderate consumption is consistent across both descriptions, highlighting a shared health advisory.\n\nIn summary, SOUP POWDER is a convenient, flavor-rich seasoning product that enables quick preparation of soups without the need for fresh ingredients or lengthy cooking. While it offers practical benefits in modern culinary practices, its high sodium content necessitates mindful consumption to support long-term heart health. As a staple in both home and professional kitchens, SOUP POWDER remains a valuable tool for enhancing meals, provided it is used in balanced and measured amounts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 500, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 795, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
