This vegetable is prized for its crisp, sweet texture and is commonly used in stir-fries, salads, and soups. It is low in calories and high in dietary fiber, making it a nutritious addition to a balanced diet. Baby corn is cholesterol-free and contains no known allergens, rendering it a safe and suitable option for individuals following vegan or allergen-free diets.\n\nNutritionally, a 100-gram serving of baby corn contains 81.1 calories, 2.5 grams of protein, 18.7 grams of carbohydrates, and 1.1 grams of fat. It is particularly rich in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A and vitamin C, which support immune function and skin health. Additionally, it provides significant amounts of iron, sodium, calcium, and potassium—nutrients vital for blood health, bone strength, and proper muscle and nerve function. Its high fiber content promotes digestive wellness and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels.\n\nDue to its early harvest stage, baby corn retains a delicate, tender consistency that distinguishes it from mature corn. This makes it ideal for culinary applications where a fresh, crisp texture is desired. Its mild flavor and versatility allow it to complement a wide range of dishes, from Asian-inspired stir-fries to light, refreshing salads and hearty soups. The vegetable is also valued for its natural, unprocessed nature, offering a wholesome and minimally altered food source.\n\nDespite its small size and early maturity, baby corn is nutritionally dense and offers a broad spectrum of health benefits. Its low caloric profile combined with high fiber and essential micronutrients makes it an excellent choice for health-conscious consumers, athletes, and individuals managing weight or specific dietary needs. It is widely available in markets and grocery stores, often sold in pre-packaged or fresh forms, and is a staple in many global cuisines, especially in Asian cooking traditions.\n\nWhile some sources may describe baby corn as being eaten only with the cob, the more accurate and comprehensive understanding is that it can be consumed either with or without the cob, depending on regional culinary practices and preparation methods. The cob, when included, adds structural integrity and a slight chew, while the corn kernels provide the primary flavor and texture. Regardless of preparation, baby corn remains a nutritious, accessible, and versatile ingredient.\n\nIn summary, baby corn is a healthy, natural, and nutrient-rich vegetable that combines low calories with high fiber and essential vitamins and minerals. It is a safe, allergen-free, and plant-based food option suitable for diverse dietary needs, including vegan and low-allergen diets. Its crisp texture and mild flavor make it a popular choice in both home cooking and professional kitchens, contributing to a balanced and flavorful diet.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 586, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 912, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}}
